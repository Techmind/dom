A sickle made from beaten bronze with runes inscribed along its edges and a blood-groove running down the center of the blade, this tool is not used to cut rye or wheat.  Instead, its harvest is of a far more sinister nature. When used in battle, the magic in the blade awakens and the sickle will harvest the pain of all those killed. Anyone surviving a hit from the sickle will start to decay and will die within minutes.
