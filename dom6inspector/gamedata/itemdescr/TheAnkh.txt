Also known as the Amulet of Life, the Ankh was made in ancient times to cheat Death of its prize. The mere presence of the Ankh prohibits the souls of the dead from leaving this world. Even the soul of the wearer will not pass on upon death. Instead, the soul will reanimate the corpse of the Ankh wearer.  The powers of the Amulet of Life are so strong that the wearer may decide who will die and who will continue to fight when Death calls.
