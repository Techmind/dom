This orb was sculpted from pure air and is constantly sparkling and crackling from the lightning trapped inside it. A mage wielding this orb will be able to greatly increase his power over air. However the orb's true power lies in the summoning of air elementals, those will be extremely powerful if summoned while wielding the orb.
