A sceptre of silver and steel, set with tourmalines and enchanted with black magic, this sceptre was crafted by Shantanok, the ruler of the Black Coven, in the forges of the Obsidian Citadel. A trained necromancer wielding this sceptre will be able to bend the power of Death magic to his will. But it comes with a cost because, while wielding the sceptre, the necromancer will age at an accelerated rate.
