As soon as this sword is drawn, the blade will burst into flames and anyone close to where it strikes will be burned by a burst of extremely hot fire. Earth magic has been used to sharpen the edges of this sword so that it can cut straight through any armor. The flaming sword partially protects its wielder from fire.
