This weapon is composed of three globes shining with a faint light, all connected to each other with a thin red cord. When thrown against an enemy, it will wrap itself around the target, immobilizing him. The bola will reform itself in its user's hands after being thrown and only imaginary threads will remain tying up the enemy.
