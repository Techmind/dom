This is a simple wooden stick with an inflated bladder attached to one end, much like the bladders carried by fools and jesters. The bladder of this particular weapon is taken from an unbelievably venomous snake and is enchanted to fill with poisonous gas that puffs out of the stick whenever it strikes an enemy.  The poisonous gas puff is quite large and can easily kill both the wielder and his enemies unless they are properly protected.
