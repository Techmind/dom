A dark green crystalline jewel that throbs with a dull light, this item is used by spies to poison wells near enemy armies. Its poisonous radiance is so strong that the land itself will begin to suffer under its curse. Crops and foliage will sicken and die and both men and beasts will suffer the curse of the Bane Venom Charm. Even its bearer, who is shielded by the most powerful protective runes, knows that the sickness inhabiting the charm will also afflict him. Once the charm is removed from the lab, it will begin to poison whatever province it is located in.
