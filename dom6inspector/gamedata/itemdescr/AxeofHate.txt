Enchanting this axe takes a long period of time, during which it is used to slowly chop down the tree from which it was made. This yields an axe enchanted by Nature that has a natural hatred for living beings. Any living being struck by the axe will have some of his energy drained from him and risks getting a deadly disease. The person wielding this axe will suffer the minor side effect of being very susceptible to poison.
