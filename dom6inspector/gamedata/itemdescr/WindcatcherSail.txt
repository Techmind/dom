The Weavers of Phaeacia make the sails of the fabled Dark Ships that travel without oars or captains. But their skill in weaving and sail-making is not limited to the Dark Sails. They also make Windcatcher Sails used by regular ships to travel quick and far. A commander equipped with a Windcatcher Sail can travel one province further than normal with a sailing army.
