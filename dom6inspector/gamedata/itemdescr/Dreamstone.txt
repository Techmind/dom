Anyone wielding this stone for a few days will suddenly start to dream every night and remember them clearly afterwards. A glamour mage can use this to steer the dreams into conjuring useful magic research ideas. Then he can write down the dreams in the morning and thus speed up his research greatly. The drawback is that opening of the mage's senses to let the dreams in will also make him more vulnerable to hostile magic effects.
