This large, round shield is carved with disturbing patterns. The patterns on the shield are locked into the very fabric of reality. Any disturbance to their integrity will risk damaging the Veil that locks out the Horrors, allowing the Horrors to mark the striker for special attention. The patterns on the shield are also painful to look at and will cause opponents to have problems focusing on the shield and its bearer.
