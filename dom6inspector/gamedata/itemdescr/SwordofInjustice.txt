A simple sword of ordinary appearance, this blade was once not unlike other swords. After it was worn and wielded by the Grand Censor of Ermor who used it to mete out his depraved justice, it acquired considerable power from the innumerable innocents that died on its blade. The residue of these injustices residing in the blade was enhanced during the cataclysmic fall of Ermor, when it absorbed considerable amounts of unholy energy. The sword will now increase the holy might of its wielder and will strike anyone it hits with the rot of Hell. It also enables the owner to protect his undead minions from banishment.
