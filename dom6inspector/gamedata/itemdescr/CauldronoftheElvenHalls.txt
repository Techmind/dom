A great silver cauldron enchanted with the magic of the Vanir. Soup made in the silver cauldron will turn those who feed on it invisible. By the law of some unknown power the enchantment ends when weapons are drawn and battle begins. The army with the cauldron appears to be 75 units smaller than it actually is.
