In Magnificent Ind are worms called in Salamanders. These worms can only live in fire, and they build cocoons like silk-worms. The cocoons are unwound by the ladies of the Sublime Palace, and spun into cloth and dresses. These dresses protect its wearer from heat and flames and, in order to be cleaned and washed, are cast into flames that burn the stains away. These dresses are so finely woven that every observer is struck by their beauty and brilliance.
