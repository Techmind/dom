This black crown is a laurel that was once carried by the dictator who plunged Ermor into the endless despair of undeath. The twisted and blackened leaves of the crown still command the respect of the Lictors of Ermor, who will remember their ancient oaths and shamble forth to mete out the justice of their dictator. Three additional Lictors are summoned with the spell Revive Lictor. This item is only useful to the Ashen Empire of Ermor.
