This trap was devised by the feared Blood mage Ardmon. Inside it he trapped the heads of those opponents he deemed worthy to be preserved. In battle a few of the trapped spirits will emerge and aid the wielder of the Soul Trap. Some heads come from mighty warriors and some come from Fire and Earth mages. Holding this many souls is demanding and will tax the strength of the wielder of the Soul Trap.
