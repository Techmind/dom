The Ivy Crown is a replica of the ivy crowns that were worn by exalted Vine Men in the ancient times before men came and drove them away. The forests and the Vine Men who live there perceive the wearer as an ancient Vine Lord and will gladly assist him. The crown is of great help when awakening vine creatures and will increase the effect of the Awaken Vine Men and Awaken Vine Ogre spells.
