Picus and Procas were two brothers who ruled a kingdom together. They were both wise mages: Picus was a specialist in Blood magic and Procas in Death magic. In order to strengthen their hold on the kingdom, they decided to forge a set of magic weapons together. Picus's axe was made to strengthen and protect the brothers and Procas's axe was made to put fear in both their enemies and the population.

Whenever a citizen was to be punished, one of the brothers would chop off one of the citizen's arms and soon the axes became known as the Axes of Evil. The magic of the axes only manifested when the axes were wielded by both brothers simultaneously. Picus and Procas later died trying to defend their kingdom against a barbarian horde. The barbarian chief then managed to unleash the power of the axes by using one in each hand.
