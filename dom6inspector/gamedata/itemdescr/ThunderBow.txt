When the string of the Thunder Bow is drawn, a lightning bolt will appear where the arrow should have been, ready to be fired at the archer's enemies. The further the string is drawn, the more powerful the lightning bolt will be. The Thunder Bow can be a very formidable weapon in the hands of a man with strong arms and a good eye.
