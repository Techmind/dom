The weapon smiths of T'ien Ch'i have mastered the means to balance the elements into a single perfect blade. The weapon is usually given to kings and princes, but sometimes an accomplished swordmaster is granted one of the perfect blades. The Sword of Five Elements is remarkably well balanced and reinvigorates its wielder.
