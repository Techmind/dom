The God-Slayer Spears have been forged by the Elder Cyclopses to help their allies get rid of the Gods. Pretender Gods can be tricky to hit and harm, but not with these spears. Any God standing even close to where the spear hits will be struck by a wave of fatigue and a few of these spears will soon put down even the mightiest Pretender. Sacred units will be equally affected by the fatigue.
