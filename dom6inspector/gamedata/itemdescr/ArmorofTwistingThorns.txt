Thorns will protrude from all over the mage's body. The thorns twist whenever the mage makes any sudden movements, making combat and spell casting extremely arduous. However, the blood that is brought forth by the thorns will enhance the mage's power in Blood and Nature magic. The thorns are poisonous, so striking the mage without the use of a long weapon is not recommended.
