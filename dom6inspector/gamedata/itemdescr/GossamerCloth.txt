A piece of cloth made from dreams and hopes. It is said that the Tuatha wear clothing made from gossamer for they have the power of Glamour. The Gossamer Cloth enables its wearer to cover his fellows in glamour and shadows, preventing them from being detected by enemy scouts. Up to 25 units are made invisible by the enchantment of the cloth, although the enchantment does not function when weapons are drawn and battle begins.
