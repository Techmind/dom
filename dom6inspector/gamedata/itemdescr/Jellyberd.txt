A grotesque polearm in the shape of a runed iron shaft ending in a pulsing reddish jellyfish, trailing stinging tendrils. Those who have seen it wielded by the Illithids have dubbed it the jellyberd. When swung the tendrils will flail about and will not just hit the primary target, but will strike anyone standing close to the target too, paralyzing and poisoning those struck. The jellyfish also protects its wielder with an astral force.
