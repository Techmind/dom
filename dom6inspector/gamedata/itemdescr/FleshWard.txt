The Flesh Ward is a breastplate, in a very literal sense. It is constructed out of a still-bloody ribcage that envelops the wearer's chest. Upon first donning the ribcage, the wearer will find that the ribcage fastens itself to him with tendons and tissue, sending veins into his body to supply it with sustenance. The ribcage will grant its wearer amazing strength and ease his use of Blood magic. It will also channel the force of any attack into the person who harmed him instead. This channeling of wounds works regardless of distance, but strong magic resistance may save the attacker.
