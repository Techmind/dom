Trapped inside this snake-shaped jade amulet is the spirit of a very venomous serpent. Whenever the wearer of the amulet strikes at someone, the spirit will emerge and strike simultaneously, ignoring any armor that the enemy might be wearing. The serpent spirit will also grant the amulet's wearer partial resistance from poison.
