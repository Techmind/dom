The Blood mage sacrifices nearly fivescore slaves to get the attention of Infernal powers.  When contact is made, an Infernal Lord offers a contract, to be signed in blood. Whoever signs the contract promises his soul, to be collected at the time of his death, to the Infernal Lord.  In exchange for this fair and valuable consideration, the signatory will, for as long as he lives, receive one bound devil each month from the Infernal Lord.
