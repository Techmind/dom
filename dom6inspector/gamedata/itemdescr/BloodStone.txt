The wound on this stone is constantly wet from Earth Blood. This dark blood is of great help when using Earth magic. This blood can also be crystallized into Earth gems to power spells and enchantments in battle. The crystallized Earth Blood is too brittle and unstable to store for long periods and cannot be used for more time consuming rituals.
