The Black Dryads of the Vengeful Woods creates magic bows will fire arrows of bones and infected vines at the target. The vine arrows are not very accurate, but they will halt anyone hit and possibly infect them with a carrion seed. If the victim dies during the battle the seed will sprout and reanimate the corpse as a manikin serving the dark God of Asphodel.
