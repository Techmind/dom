The Pearl of Light is the most prized possession of the Dragon King. It was given to the Bodhisattva of Mercy after she saved his son from being eaten by unknowing fishermen who had caught the Dragon Prince in the shape of a fish. The Bodhisattva only accepted the gift if the messenger, the Dragon King's granddaughter, would take the Pearl instead. The Dragon Girl and the Bodhisattva are now inseparable, and Longnu carries the Pearl at all times.
