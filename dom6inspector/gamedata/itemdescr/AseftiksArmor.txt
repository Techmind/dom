This golden full plate armor was crafted for the hero Aseftik to wear in his battle against Harakhtor of the Black Coven. The armor is more skillfully crafted than any other armor ever made. Only the black Monolith Armor worn by the lord whom Aseftik fought is heavier. The armor is said to have protected Aseftik from the magic of the Black Coven.
