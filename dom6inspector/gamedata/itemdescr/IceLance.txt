The Ice Lance is a spear made mostly out of ice and enchanted with Water magic that increases the defensive skills of the wielder. As a light lance this weapon is most effective on its first strike and when used by fast or flying units. Like all ice weapons it cannot be affected by any flaming weapon enhancement.
