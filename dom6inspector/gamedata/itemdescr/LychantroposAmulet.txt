This iron amulet is crafted in the image of a wolf's head. Its eyes are as red as the rage that fills the heart of the wearer. The amulet grants the wearer regenerative powers in addition to increased strength, berserker rage, and superior night vision. The wild powers of the amulet will eventually turn the wearer into a beast.
