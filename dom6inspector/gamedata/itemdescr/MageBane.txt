As the name implies, this sword was designed to destroy mages. The sword gives increased magic resistance to its wielder and anyone hit by the blade will be struck unconscious. This power of the Mage Bane cannot be stopped by any magic resistance. Magic beings struck by the weapon may be destroyed as the magical energies that animate them are dissolved.
