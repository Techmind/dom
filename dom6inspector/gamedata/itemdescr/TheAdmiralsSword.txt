This sword was used by Admiral Torgrin to kill many people during his life. When he was finally killed, he rose from the dead and continued killing as an undead. During the centuries of killing, this sword has become more and more bent with heavy use. Anyone who survives a hit from this sword will be cursed for the rest of his life.
