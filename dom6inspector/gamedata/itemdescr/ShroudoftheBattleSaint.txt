This simple shroud is drenched in the blood of champions of the Faith who have fallen in battle. The blood on the shroud never dries and the wearer is constantly reminded of his predecessors' greatness by the smell and fresh wetness of their blood. The wearer is always blessed, even if he is not sacred. Once worn, the shroud cannot be removed.
