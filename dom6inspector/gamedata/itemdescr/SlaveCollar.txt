This copper collar is sometimes given by magicians to cowardly commanders. The power of the collar serves to kill the free will of the wearer, making him obedient and less prone to panic during battle. As a side effect, the wearer also becomes feebleminded. Once equipped, the Slave Collar cannot be removed. When the wearer of the collar dies the slave collar will lose its effect and become an ordinary useless collar.
