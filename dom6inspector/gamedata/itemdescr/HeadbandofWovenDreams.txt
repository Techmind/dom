With the help of magic the dreams of a hundred old men are woven into a beautiful headband. When worn the crown will project its sleep inducing dreams at any nearby enemies, making them fall asleep instantly. The headband has been adorned with an enchanted purple pearl, designed to keep the wearer safe from the sleep inducing magics of the dreams.
