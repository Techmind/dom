By replacing the bearer's ordinary heart with this one, the owner will recover from exhaustion at an amazing rate and, as a side effect, will efficiently rid his body of poison. The crude surgery required to replace the heart will most likely permanently damage its owner. One being can have multiple magic hearts at once. Inanimate beings cannot use magic hearts.
