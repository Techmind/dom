This orb was sculpted from pure water and is constantly making pleasant sounds from the waves trapped inside it. A mage wielding this orb will be able to greatly increase his power over water. However the orb's true power lies in the summoning of water elementals, those will be extremely powerful if summoned while wielding the orb.
