A large and robust scythe with a rusty blade, it is always accompanied by an overpowering smell of blood. When this blade is wielded, the smell of blood becomes ever stronger and its wielder is filled with the rapturous joy of slaughter. Wading into the enemy ranks, the wielder swings the hungry blade in wide arcs, cutting off the calves of his horrified enemies, who are felled like rye at harvest.
