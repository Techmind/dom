A bracelet made of the legendary Moonvine, which flowers only under the full moon and bears fruit only during lunar eclipses, this simple bracelet will serve to link its wearer more closely to the powers of Nature and increase his command of plant life. This allows him to call upon the aid of one Vine Man in battle.
