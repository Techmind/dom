This eye, taken from a dead Void being, should be put in the eye socket of a newly removed eye. By doing this, the patient will open a path to the Void into which he can see with his new eye. This will enable him to see the world as it really is and see through any illusion very effectively. He will also be able to cast spells more effectively, but at the cost of also being more vulnerable to enemy spells.
