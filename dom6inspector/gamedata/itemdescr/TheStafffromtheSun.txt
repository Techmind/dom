A mighty astrologer who studied the Sun discovered that a branch of some kind was stuck on the underside of the Sun. After researching a spell to loosen the branch, he traveled to directly below the Sun. He performed the ritual to loosen the branch, and this magic staff was what fell into the desert, right where the astrologer was.
