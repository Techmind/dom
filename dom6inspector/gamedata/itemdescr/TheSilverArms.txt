After having observed the gods for a long while, a most cunning dwarf created these magic silver arms in an earlier era in order to replicate the power of the gods.  The secret of the gods is that they have 4 arms instead of two like the mortal beings.  By attaching these arms a mortal being can get power close to that of the gods and the ability to wield four weapons at once.
