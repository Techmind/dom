Gustius was the most famous mage of the discipline of mind and dreams. Having completed the studies of the human mind he decided to begin the study of horrors instead, probably in order to save humankind from their influence. The pinnacle of his achievements was the successful capture of the dreams of Hruvur, the Abomination of Desolation, a horror of immense power. After capturing these dreams he grew not only more powerful, but also increasingly mad and eventually he was found maimed and dead in his laboratory. The gem in which he trapped the horror's dreams was still there however, better hide it away somewhere safe.
