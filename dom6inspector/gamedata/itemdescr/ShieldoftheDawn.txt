At the dawn of time a great Enkidu hero crafted a set of magical weapons under the tutelage of the Sun. Now known only as the Dawn Warrior, he forged the First Kingdom. His items were crafted from bronze and set with lapis lazuli, the stone of the sky and the kings of old. Under the rays of the sun, the items grant their wearer the prowess and splendor of the Sun himself. The items also grant their wearer resistance against wounds and and protection from magic.
