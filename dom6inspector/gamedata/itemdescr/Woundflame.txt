This short sword of black steel was quenched in the blood of lepers and the tears of plague victims during its creation. Any wounds inflicted by this blade will become grievously infected and fester at a supernatural rate. Furthermore, the bearer of the sword will become an infected carrier of an extremely virulent disease to which he and anyone nearby will likely succumb, unless undead.
