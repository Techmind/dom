A very sturdy sledgehammer made of the blackest dwarven iron, this hammer was made by an ancient Vanheim dwarf to help him in battle and in his craft. It is enchanted with the magic of Fire and Earth. When it strikes, it unleashes tremendous heat, and, when swung in the forge, it will ease the burden on the smith and facilitate his work.
