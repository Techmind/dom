A branding iron, ever hot and glowing red, forged in the House of Just Fires. The brand bears with it the terrible authority of the inquisition, and anyone whose flesh it marks will experience the excruciating pain of absolute truth. The dread that this implement inspires make it a useful tool when rooting out heretics, and when brandished in battle it will fill those who see it with great fear.
