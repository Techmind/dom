The Nabaean Sahirs are known for their skills in Jinn magic. But some of them also summon and bind Jinn and trap them in ceramic bottles. The bottle gives its owner an enslaved Jinn. The Jinn serves its master in all manners, such as cooking or opening doors and windows to keep the owner cool. The owner will be protected from the scorching winds of the desert, but the Jinn is also a skilled warrior that protects him in battles.
