Wraith Crowns are worn by the wraith lords of the Underworld. The crown will summon undead servants at the start of a battle. The wearer of the crown will be able to command undead beings as if he were a necromancer. The crown will also make its wearer ethereal and thus almost invulnerable to non-magical weapons.
