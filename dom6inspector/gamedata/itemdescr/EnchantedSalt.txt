Many ghosts and spiritual beings, and the Jinnun of Ubar in particular, are sensitive to salt. One of the few means to protect oneself from the Unseen is salt. When enchanted, salt will not only cause discomfort, but outright harm Jinnun. Enchanted salt thrown at the Unseen will stun them, harm them, disrupt their glamour and force them to become visible.
