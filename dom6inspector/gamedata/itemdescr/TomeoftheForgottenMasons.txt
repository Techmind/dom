Master Masons are known for their great skill at constructing fortifications, but there was a trio of Masons who showed skills that were far beyond that which other Master Masons could achieve. The trio of Masons constructed some of the most wonderful buildings before they disappeared and were never heard from again. Most people forgot about them, but the Master Masons remembered and continued to research how they could construct such buildings. Rumor says the trio made a pact with infernal powers using blood sacrifices to gain their great skills. The owner of this tome will be able to construct forts that are one level better than what would otherwise be possible.
