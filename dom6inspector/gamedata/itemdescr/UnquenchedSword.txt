This blade is made of solid Fire tempered in an Elemental brazier. The flames that lick the ever-burning edge are incredibly hot and will cut through armor and flesh with equal ease. The heat of the blade will cause the temperature to rise on the entire battlefield and everyone to suffer from severe fatigue unless protected. This sword should be wielded only by those protected from fire.
