The Crown of the Shah is the Crown made by the High Magi for the Shahanshah, King of Kings. The Shahs are petty kings of Ragha and their power stems from the kingdom, not from the Shah himself. The Crown is linked to the land itself and will give the Shah vast religious authority as the Shahanshah. Only one among the Shahs can be appointed King of Kings and his powers are linked to his crown. Should the king die, a new crown must be forged for the new Shahanshah. There can only be one Crown and it can only be used by a Shah of Ragha. The Shahanshah will never give up his crown, and only if the king dies can a new one be made.
