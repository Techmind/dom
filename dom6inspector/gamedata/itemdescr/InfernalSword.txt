This sword was first forged by Igarak the Arch Devil and given to a devoted servant in the world of the living. Anyone struck by the sword will be banished from the world and sent to the Inferno. Getting back from there is not easy, but stories have been told of great heroes who were banished to the Inferno and made their way back alive.
