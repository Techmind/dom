With the aid of Phlegyas the Theurg Tyrant and his superior arcane understanding, the Elder Cyclopes have crafted the means to dominate mages joined in communion. All oppressors are equipped with iron headbands and are trained to join the communion. Untrained mages, such as the Gigante Tyrants, are given headbands with stronger enchantments that take magical resources to craft.
