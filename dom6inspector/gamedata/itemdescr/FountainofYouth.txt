When the Fountain of Youth was first discovered it was too far away from the kings who would surely benefit the most from a very long life. So a large royal barrel was filled up with the water. The fountain dried up shortly after but, on the other hand, the barrel seems to never run out of its magic water. By drinking a spoonful of water from the barrel once a week you can halt most of the aging process and expect a significantly longer life. Everyone in the same province as the barrel will be able to drink from it and receive this benefit.
