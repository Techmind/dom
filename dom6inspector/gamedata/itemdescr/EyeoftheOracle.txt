 Athandemos was once the greatest oracle and foreteller of a vast kingdom. He managed to foresee and prevent every major problem that arose in the kingdom and was liked by the King for a long time.  Then the King's favorite daughter died suddenly and the Oracle was swiftly killed for withholding this information.  Still there was no doubt that Athandemos had been most useful for a long time and thus the King ordered his mages to preserve the left eye of Athandemos.  This was the eye that saw into the future and the King let his own left eye be replaced with that of Athandemos.  Now no one would be able to withhold the future events from the rightful ruler.
 In addition to foreseeing great events, the eye can also see the near future which is very helpful in combat.
