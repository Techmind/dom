The ancient god who once wore these chains is unknown, but the purpose of the chains is not. They once held a fallen god captive in the Underworld, but he apparently broke free, since the chains now exist in the world of men. Some of the power of their captive is still retained in the black iron of their coils. When swung, the chains hit with tremendous force, but their primary power is that anyone surviving the force of the blow runs the risk of having his soul enslaved to the wielder of the chains. The chains have a downside, though. Anyone who wields these chains will soon find himself attacked by guards from the Underworld.
