This flail is made of human bones bound with iron. Instead of spiked balls, its chains are tipped with mummified hands enchanted with the magic of Death. When the flail is swung, the chill touch of the hands will cause extreme discomfort to anyone hit. The hands will also aid during spell casting by making helpful gestures at crucial moments.
