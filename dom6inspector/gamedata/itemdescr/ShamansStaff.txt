Even though this staff is useful for all mages, it is especially useful for those who can manipulate the powers of nature.  A nature mage wielding this staff will be able to cast his nature spells at a greater range than what would otherwise be possible.  In addition to this the staff will also help all mages deal with fatigue and overcome the magic resistance of enemies.
