Anyone who puts these boots on will find himself moving and acting much more quickly. When used in battle, the boots make their wearer attack and run at about twice the normal speed. Spell casting is not affected because the time it takes to gather the power required for a spell is not influenced by the enchantment of the boots. A side effect of using these boots is that the wearer will also grow old twice as fast as ordinary people.
