Spells cast with the help of a Spell Focus are harder to resist with magic resistance. This item can be most useful when trying to affect enemy mages with spells that can be negated by magic resistance. A side effect of using this item is the luck induced in the mage. This luck can be useful but it turns bad after being used up.
