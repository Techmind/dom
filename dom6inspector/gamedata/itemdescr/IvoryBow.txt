This horrible bow is made from the Ivory of the Underworld, human bones. It is strangely shaped and would not work, were it not enchanted with Air magic. The bow fires volleys of deadly arrows burning with the sickly green flames of bane fire. As if this was not enough, the arrows will trap the souls of those killed, coercing their bodies to continue fighting, but for a new master, their slayer.
