This beautiful but ominous crown was originally crafted by the sorcerer-king Raig√∂mur, who was also the high priest of the Prince of Death. Those who behold the crown will quiver in fear. The crown is of great help when performing Death magic and when animating the dead, but the crown also makes the wearer grow attached to it and only death will see them apart.
