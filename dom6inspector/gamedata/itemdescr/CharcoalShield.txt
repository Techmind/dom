A massive, round shield made of beaten bronze and set with ever-glowing coals whose fierce heat can be felt several feet away, this shield was reputedly made by the same god who once constructed the Aegis. Anyone who strikes the surface of the shield will find that the immense heat of the shield will instantly pass through his weapon and into his body, causing extreme pain. The shield partially protects its wielder from fire.
