This horrid living weapon is grown in the lightless chasms of the deep seas. It consists of a fleshy stalk, serving as a haft, ending in a living anemonelike creature with swaying tendrils that searchingly probe the air. Any victim struck by the mace will be stung, stunned, seared, and disgusted as the tendrils lash out, seeking the warmth of exposed flesh.
