A staff carved from the trunk of a dying Treelord, it is alive and covered with bark and leaves sprouting along its entire length. The power of the dying Treelord will mightily increase the owner's skills in Nature magic. When traveling in forests, the trees will make way for the power of this staff as best they can, making traveling as easy as on a road. The staff is also of great help when awakening vine creatures in the forest and will increase the effectiveness of the Awaken Vine Men and Awaken Vine Ogre spells.
