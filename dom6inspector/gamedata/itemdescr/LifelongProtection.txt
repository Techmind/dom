The Blood mage sacrifices twoscore slaves to get the attention of Infernal powers. When contact is made, a powerful demon will offer a contract, to be signed in blood. Whoever signs his name to the contract will be protected in battle by a horde of imps. In exchange for this fair and valuable consideration, he agrees to transfer his soul to the demon when the contract ends.
