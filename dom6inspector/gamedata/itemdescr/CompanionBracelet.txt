The wearer of this silver bracelet has bonded with a Qarin, a Jiniri spirit companion that protects him and aids him in magical research and other endeavors. The Qarin has some skills in air and astral magic and will aid him in battles with protective spells. The bond between the wearer and the Qarin is unbreakable once the final vows are spoken and the bracelet cannot be removed.
