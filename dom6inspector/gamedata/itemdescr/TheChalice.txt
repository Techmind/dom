The bearer of this much sought after artifact will live in constant peril for the rest of his life, for questing knights will come from time to time and seek to wrest it from his hands. The golden cup is filled with blood of unknown origin that, when applied to wounds, will instantly close them.  The blood can heal all manner of ills and afflictions and the wielder of the chalice will never grow old.
