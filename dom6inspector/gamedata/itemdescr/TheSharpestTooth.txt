This is the sharpest tooth from the most venomous Wyrm ever known to have lived. It is now empowered with two sets of runes. The first amplifies the potency of the tooth's venom and enhances the poison resistance of its wielder. The second rune will grant the wielder extreme patience and enhanced awareness of his surroundings, which can make an assassin extremely efficient. There is no handle as such, but the base of the tooth is wrapped in angel skin to nullify the otherwise baneful effect on the wielder. It is so venomous that it will affect even poison-immune creatures.
