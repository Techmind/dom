The Huaca Headdress is a golden crown of ancient times. It represents the divine glory of the sun and will inspire Nazcans, living and dead. The divine glow of the headdress will make Huacas and their Supaya ghosts arrive in greater numbers and allow Royal Mallquis to reanimate additional Supayas. One extra per month for holy reanimation or two extra for magic rituals.
