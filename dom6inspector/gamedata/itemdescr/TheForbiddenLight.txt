This stolen piece of the Sun contains enormous power that can greatly enhance the wielder's skills in Astral and Fire magic, but this Sun material is very sought after by astral beings. In combat, the Forbidden Light will shine with a holy light that slays undead and blinds everyone else. The wielder of the Forbidden Light will grow older at an accelerated age, but that is unlikely to be his cause of death because many Horrors will also seek possession of this precious item. Any province where this piece of light is, will always count as if it is in the presence of the sun.
