This small shell is taken from a living clam and inscribed with runes of creation and absorption. The enchanted shell contains two pearls of short lived Astral essence. These pearls can be used to power up to two Astral combat spells per battle, but the pearls are not stable enough to be used for more time-consuming rituals.
