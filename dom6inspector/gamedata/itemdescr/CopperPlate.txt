The wearer of this magic plate cuirass is granted resistance to lightning.  When first struck in battle, the armor will unleash a blast of lightning upon the attacker.  There will also be a lesser lightning discharge against the wearer of the magic plate cuirass, but the lightning resistance will usually nullify that.
