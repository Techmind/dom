This huge pearl is the most prized possession of a huge dragon. The dragon would never give its pearl away, in fact it will not even put it aside for a moment, much preferring to constantly hold it and be reassured of its presence. It is often said that if a mortal gets hold of the pearl he can control the dragon. However this is most likely false and it is easy to see how a rumor like this could start considering how possessive the dragon is of its shiny pearl.
