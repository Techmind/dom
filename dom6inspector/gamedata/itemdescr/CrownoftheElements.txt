This is the crown worn by the lord of the elements. The elemental powers recognize its authority and will pay a magic gem as tribute each month. In battle a large number of lesser elementals will appear to protect the lord of the elements. A mage wearing this crown will also be able to harness some of its power into elemental magic power.
