When the Ktonian Alchemists discovered the old Agarthan secrets of mercurial alchemy they refined the methods of animating the magical metal. Instead of enchanting the liquid metal, they enchanted the barrel in which the material was contained. Enchanted barrels filled with mercury were a lot easier to move around, and the raw magical power needed to animate the metal was reduced. A problem with the magical metal is that it reeks with fumes detrimental to living beings. The barrels are often given to the reawakened dead and placed far from living soldiers.
