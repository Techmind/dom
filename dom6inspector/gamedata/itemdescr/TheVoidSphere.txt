Karomatus the Great had dedicated most of his life to his artifact that would trap a piece of the void in a magic orb. Carrying essence from the astral plane this close to you would be an enormous boost when it comes to performing magic. However no matter how much he tried, there was always something that eluded him and completing the sphere never succeeded. That was until one night when the solution appeared in a dream, by mixing in the blood of just a few young girls the sphere would become so much stronger. Staring into the Void Sphere is not without danger to the mage's mind, but there is also so much to be learned by doing it.
