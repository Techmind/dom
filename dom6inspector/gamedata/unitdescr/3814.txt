Feminie is a magocracy ruled by sorceresses of considerable power. Since the time of Magnificent Ind the sorceresses have found new forms of magic and have become powerful wielders of  glamour magic. With illusions and tricks of the mind the sorceresses and the Sage-Queens keep their queendom and its inhabitants hidden from outsiders. Sorceresses are adept mages who have chosen a more direct path to power than the more studious and curious Savants.
