With the defeat of Ermor, studies of esoterica, with or without the aid of demons, became popular. In most cases esoterica is practiced by individuals of limited magic aptitude who require external aid to perform magic. Mirror mages use enchanted mirrors as the focus for their glamour magic. Through mirrors they perceive distant lands and with mirrors they project false images. Some say they even can step through mirrors and appear through another mirror. Mirror mages have some complimentary magic skills in fire, earth, air or astral magic.
