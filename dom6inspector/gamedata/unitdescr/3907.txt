The unseelie fay are beings of the Dreamwild. The fay are generally capricious, aloof and sometimes even cruel; but the unseelie are outright malicious and hostile to mankind. Just like the seelie, the unseelie form mock courts with kings and queens ruling over vassals, soldiers and servants. But where the seelie rule over lush forests blessed with perpetual summer, the unseelie courts rule over frozen forests and hostile winter woods. Unseelie Knights wreath themselves in illusions and don glittering armors of crystal and ice that tempers in cold lands, and their swords are made of dreamwrought ice. Unseelie Knights are mounted on Fay horses stronger and swifter than any mount found in human lands. The unseelie are strongly connected to the winter and they are all resistant to cold.
