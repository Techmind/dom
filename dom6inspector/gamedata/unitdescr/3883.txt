Skadulf is the leader of the Wolf Clan Seithberenders. According to rumors, eagerly encouraged by his family, he survived his years as a cub-warrior thanks to an undead wolf who adopted him and fed him the flesh of dead jotuns. True or not, the stories explain his skills in death magic as well as his companion, a skeletal wolf.
