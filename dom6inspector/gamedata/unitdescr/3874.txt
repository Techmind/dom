The Nagasiddha is a naga sage that has achieved physical and mental perfection. It is an inhabitant of the nether realms, although it originated in this world and descended into the underworld after enlightenment. Now the Nagasiddha has returned to this world in the wake of the previous Pantokrator to claim the world as his. Nagasiddhas are able to take the shape of a humanoid siddha. In human form it loses some of its skills in water magic.
