A divine being in human form, the Harbinger is winged and armed with a heavenly horn that destroys undead beings and weaker humans. Harbingers are almost invulnerable to physical harm and surrounded by a radiant aura that intimidates cowardly beings. Harbingers have partial resistance to lightning and fire. Some Harbingers are powerful priests and adept Air mages. The harbinger will automatically join any arcane chorus as a chorus master.
