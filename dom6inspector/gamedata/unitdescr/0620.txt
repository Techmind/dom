Draconians are large, birdlike reptilians with great, leathery wings instead of arms. Draconians have sharp beaks and their saliva is somewhat poisonous. They can be seen soaring above cliffs and mountain peaks in great numbers. Contrary to popular belief they are quite intelligent and live in small tribes led by chiefs. In times of need Draconian chiefs can summon more Draconians from their tribe.
