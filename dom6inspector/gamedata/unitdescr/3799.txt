Piconye has adopted much of the religious institutions from Magnificent Ind and religion permeates society. Priests of all ranks are common and most officials and administrators are at least ordained Bishops. Since the little men of Piconye formed a kingdom in the image of Magnificent Ind they have discovered that not everyone willingly serves the church and the Awakening God. The Bishops have an important role keeping corrupt thoughts at bay.
