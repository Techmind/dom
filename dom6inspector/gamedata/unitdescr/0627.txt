Faery Queens are mighty beings from the Dreamwild that sometimes emerge in deep woodland realms where they form courts of fay beings mimicking their human counterparts. Calling themselves Queens they take the appearance of beautiful butterfly-winged females dressed in unimaginable splendour. Faery Queens are skilled mages of the Dreamwild and are adept at Glamour and Nature magic. They also have some skills in air, water or earth magic. Faery Queens are always accompanied by swarms of sprites, small faeries with insect wings that love to play tricks on unsuspecting humans. If greeted with respect Faery Queens are known to give favors to their guests and even cure them from plague and disease.
