The mountains of Pyr√®ne is home to several giant races. Of these the Mairuak are the most common. They have aided the Jentilak since times immemorial and have become close allies of the Bekrydes since their emergence from their cavernous realm. The Mairuak along with the Jentilak are responsible for the many dolmens and menhirs littering the landscape of the pyrenian mountains. Mairuak are tremendously strong and can lift and throw huge boulders upon their enemies.
