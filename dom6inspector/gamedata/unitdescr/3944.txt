A Lich Hag is the dried husk of a powerful Vaetti Hag that has performed the Lichcraft ritual on herself. The Hag removes her viscera and hides it in an urn outside her body, taking her own life in the process. Upon completing the ritual the Hag becomes an immortal Lich with increased understanding and powers of death magic. Should the body of the Lich be physically destroyed, a new one is formed from the dust of the dead.
