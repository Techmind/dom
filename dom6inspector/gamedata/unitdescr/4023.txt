The Master of the Sword is a Student of the Sword who has withdrawn from society to master the Way of the Sword. These swordmasters live reclusive lives in the depths of wild forests or atop windswept mountains, where they can practice their arts and attune themselves to the elements. A rare few of them have returned to civilization to found martial schools, take students and spread their legacy. Others have joined the armies of the nation, showing off their prowess and the superiority of their chosen elemental path. Each Master of the Sword will focus on one element and one element only, not to imbalance his inner elemental power. Masters of the Sword can deliver strikes empowered by their elemental attunement to stun opponents, physically or spiritually.
