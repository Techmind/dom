In earlier times the heavy infantry of C'tis used spears. Their role was mainly to hold the line while the slave warriors killed and died. Now, with the predator lizards gone, there is a need for soldiers both heavily armed and able to kill equally heavily armed enemies. Thus the heavy infantry of C'tis now use falchions as often as spears.
