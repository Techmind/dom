Some horrors twist nature itself in their attack upon reality. A Tree of Tainted Fruits is a void-tainted tree whose fruits are the shattered souls of unfortunate men who have become marked and consumed by Horrors from the Void. Whenever a horror-marked individual dies in the vicinity of the tree a new fruit buds on the twisted branches of the tree. These soul fruits can be released to attack nearby beings.
