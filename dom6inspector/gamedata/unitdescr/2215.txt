Belly Maw Horrors are lesser horrors resembling three-legged beings with tentacles instead of arms and a horrible maw in the center of their bloated bellies. The maw is black as the Void from which it draws its power. Those swallowed by the horrible maw will find themselves lost in the Void. Horrors are astral beings that feed on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear. They have strangely distorted perceptions and will primarily attack creatures previously marked by Astral magic. Horrors sometimes appear in highly magical countries to attack people who have been marked by evil Astral mages.
