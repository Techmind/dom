The jotuns of Muspelheim are descendants of the Muspel Giants. Their skin is black as charcoal and their eyes glow like hot embers. They are resistant to fire and flames. The jotuns of Muspelheim are perhaps not as strong as the jotuns of the frozen lands, but they are faster and their martial skills are extraordinary. Huskarlar are the personal guards of a Herse or Gode, handpicked for their skill and loyalty. All Jotuns are descendants of primordial giants hunted and slain by a God of Thunder. Thunder and lightning still recognize their old quarry and the Jotuns greatly fear the wielders of lightning.
