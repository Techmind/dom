In the wild forests of Pyr√®ne, far from any human settlements, live wild men of great stature. Older than mankind, these giants taught the first men how to toil the land and work metal. The wild men are solitary beings who live their lives in solitude or in married pairs. The females are known as Basanderak and they share most of the traits of their husbands, but they are more skilled in fertility magic and agriculture, and less skilled craftsmen. They rarely wear any clothes and mostly cover themselves with their long tresses of hair. The Basanderak are sacred to the Bekrydes, but they do not wield any priestly powers.
