The alchemists of Marignon have, with the possible aid of infernal tutors, devised means to fuse human bodies with elemental essence. The Alchemical Amalgam of Air is a living amalgam of flesh and air. Amalgams of Air are quick and skilled fighters with ethereal bodies resistant to lightning. When killed the elemental essence contained in their bodies erupts in a thunderous explosion.
