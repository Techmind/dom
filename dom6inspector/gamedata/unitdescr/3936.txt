Students of the Way are hermits and sages who practice the ancient Magic of the Way. Some travel the land in search of wisdom and understanding of the world, others sequester themselves in caves and practice extreme asceticism and self-starvation to attain insights into the nature of their own bodies. The practice of internal alchemy has given them remarkable longevity and they can survive on a diet of a few grains of rice per day. They all have some skill in Water magic, for the characteristics of Water, softness, flexibility and life-giving, are considered high ideals in the lore of the Way of the Five Elements.
