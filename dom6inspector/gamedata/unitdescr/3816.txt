When Magnificent Ind fell, its magic was salvaged by the sorceresses of Great Feminie. The most powerful of them had studied glamour magic and were able to replicate the divine veil used to hide Ind from enemies. Under the veil they formed an independent queendom ruled by mighty sorceresses. The Sage-Queens are powerful mages skilled in the astral magic practiced in Ind, but out of necessity they have complemented the magic of Ind with glamour magic. They are also the highest religious authority of the queendom.
