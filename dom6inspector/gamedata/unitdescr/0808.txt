Once the Masters of the Way were hermit sages who practiced the Magic of the Way, sequestering themselves in remote caves and forests far from the bickerings of men. They were revered, but rarely seen. In this age the Masters of the Way have mover closer and closer to society, perhaps losing some of their ancient understanding of the world. Some serve as parish priests and others travel the land, gathering followers. Others still follow the ancient tradition and sequester themselves in caves and practice extreme asceticism and self-starvation in the attempt to attain immortality. The practice of internal alchemy has given them remarkable longevity and they can survive on a diet of a few grains of rice per day. They all have some skill in Water magic, for the characteristics of Water, softness, flexibility and life-giving, are considered high ideals in the lore of the Way of the Five Elements.
