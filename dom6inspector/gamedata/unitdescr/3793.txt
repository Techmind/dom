In olden days the kingdom of Piconye was continuously harassed by strange birds and the Piconye King would personally lead his soldiers in defense of his kingdom. Finally, a brave and adventurous king led several expeditions into the wilderness to find the root of the problem. A hidden mountain full of bird-nests was found. The nests were destroyed, but the eggs were brought back to Piconye where they were hatched and reared. Since then the strange birds have been bred and trained as war mounts by the little people.
