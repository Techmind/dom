The Salamander Asp, sometimes just known as the Salamander, is a small serpent-kin related to the deadly Asp. Similar in many ways the Salamander Asp is possibly even more deadly. It is inherently attuned to the element of fire and is often found nesting in hearths and ovens. The poison of the Salamander Asp is perhaps less potent than that of the Asp, but it burns with the heat of the Salamander.
