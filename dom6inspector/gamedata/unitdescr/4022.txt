Martial schools have established themselves in the cities of the nation, attracting young students willing to practice the Way of the Sword. The most famous of these schools teach their students how to channel the way of the five elements into their martial arts. The Student of the Sword is trained in martial arts as well as in the way of one of the five elements. They are able to wield magic to enhance their martial skills, but rarely delve into the more theoretical aspects of magic.
