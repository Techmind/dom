The Gorgons were three divine sisters born at the dawn of time. When the youngest of them was assaulted by a servant of the Pantokrator they were collectively punished for defending her. The sisters were transformed into beasts of horrific appearance. Their hair are masses of snakes and their eyes burn with amber fire. Great flapping bat wings grow from their shoulders. So horrible were their appearance that anyone who looked upon their faces turned to stone. But this was not enough for the servant. On his request the Pantokrator imprisoned the three gorgons for eternity and the youngest sister was bereft of her immortality, should she ever escape her prison. Now with the Pantokrator gone one of the sisters is stirring and her shackles are weakening.
