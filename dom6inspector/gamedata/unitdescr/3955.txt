There is no king in Muspelheim and the jotuns of the frozen lands are ruled by subservient Jarls. The Jarls are served by lesser chieftains known as Godar and Herses. The Jarl is a religious as well as a martial leader. He is supposed to perform the sacrifices and offerings to the gods of the land and the Awakening Lord. The Jarls are able commanders and skilled fighters who fear nothing except the occasional bolt of thunder.
