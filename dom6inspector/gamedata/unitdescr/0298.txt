Illusions are not real enough to actually harm their opponents, but the false damage inflicted is made real by the presence of glamour magic. Once all glamour mages leave, any wounds inflicted by an illusion will simply disappear. However, if someone receives enough false damage, he will die for real soon afterwards. If there are no glamour mages left, all illusions will start to dissolve.
