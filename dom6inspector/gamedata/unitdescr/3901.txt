The fay are beings of the Dreamwild. They mimic the dreams and legends of mankind and form mock courts with queens ruling over vassals, soldiers and servants. Fay Knights wreath themselves in illusions and don shimmering armors of crystal and mother of pearl, and their swords are made of dreamwrought glass. Fay Knights are mounted on Fay horses stronger and swifter than any mount found in human lands.
