The alchemists of Marignon have, with the possible aid of infernal tutors, devised means to fuse human bodies with elemental essence. The Alchemical Amalgam of Water is a living amalgam of flesh and water. Amalgams of Water are strong and skilled fighters able to breathe and act freely under water. Their nature allows them to extrude mother of pearl to cover their weapons and armor, giving them  a touch of the elemental essence contained in the amalgam. When killed the elemental essence contained in their bodies erupts in an explosion of slimy goo.
