Ladies at Arms are female warriors from less influential noble families who cannot afford the heavy armor and steed of the Lady Knights. Trained in combat since a young age they are both skilled and loyal. Ladies at Arms often swear lifelong servitude to a mage or savant and serve as their bodyguards and faithful companions.
