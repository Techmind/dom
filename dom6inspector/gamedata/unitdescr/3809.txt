Since the fall of Magnificent Ind, Feminie is ruled by a group of Sage-Queens and their Lady Warriors. Women hold power in the land and the military is dominated by female nobles. Most noble girls are trained in combat, battle sports and jousting from a young age. Lady Warriors who can afford a horse and armor will become knights. The Lady Knights of Feminie are little known to the outside world, but have caused considerable concern among their enemies when they have left the hidden queendom to conquer or punish a treacherous neighbor.
