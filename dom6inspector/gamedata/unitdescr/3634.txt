The Fir Bolg once inhabited the realms now known as Eriu and Man. They were subjugated by the Tuatha and served as farmers and warriors for that race. With the coming of man horses became more numerous and some Fir Bolg adopted human tactics when fighting in the lowlands. Fir Bolg Charioteers enter battle driving wood and wickerwork chariots.
