The jotuns of Muspelheim are descendants of the Muspel Giants. Their skin is black as charcoal and their eyes glow like hot embers. They are resistant to fire and flames. The jotuns of Muspelheim are perhaps not as strong as the jotuns of the frozen lands, but they are faster and their martial skills are extraordinary. In Jotun lands the Hird is the personal guard of a Jarl, chosen from the best warriors of the land. In Muspelheim the Muspel Giants fill the role of the Jarls' personal guards, but the Jarls still employ skilled jotun warriors of lesser stature in their Hird. These Muspel Hirdmen are the elites of the lesser Muspel Jotuns, armed with the best equipment available. Jotuns are descendants of primordial giants hunted and slain by a God of Thunder. Thunder and lightning still recognize their old quarry and the Jotuns greatly fear the wielders of lightning bolts.
