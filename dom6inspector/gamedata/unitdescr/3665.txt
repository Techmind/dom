Kimpurushas are divine lion-headed warriors that left this world ages ago. They serve the Celestial Gods, but are sometimes summoned to this world by the monkey people living on the sacred mountain where the worlds lie closer. Kimpurushas are blessed with an Aura of Splendor that strikes mortals with awe.
