While the religious ceremonies of the Herseâ€™s personal household and surroundings are the privilege of the Herse himself, there are other priests who have religious authority almost on par with the Muspel Jarls themselves. The Gode is a priest and elder knowledgeable in the ancient laws. They are blessed with ancestral insights and are able to wield the magic of Muspelheim. They perform religious ceremonies as well as arbite in trials at the Thing. Their collective word is sacred and is considered an extension of the will of the Muspel Jarls. Many Godar follow the Jarls to bless the army and perform the Blot before battle. Godar rarely arm themselves for intense fighting, but usually carry a sword and a shield.
