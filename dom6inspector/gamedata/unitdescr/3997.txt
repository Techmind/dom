The Queen of Winter is an unseelie Faery Queen, a mighty being of the Dreamwild. They form courts of fay beings mimicking their human counterparts with servants, soldiers and vassals. In the dreamwild the lands are divided between the seelie summer courts and the unseelie winter courts. Faery Queens of the summer courts are known to be friendly and even give favors to their guests. Winter Queens not so. They are cold, malicious and even hostile to mankind. The Queens of Winter are as coldly beautiful as the winter night. They don dresses of frozen moonbeams and icicles. Winter Queens are skilled in glamour and water magic. They also have some skills in air or death magic. Winter Queens are always accompanied by swarms of sprites, small faeries with insect wings that love to play tricks on unsuspecting humans.
