Maruts are storm-born divine warriors armed with lightning and demon-slaying swords. While once of this world, they left it for the celestial realms ages ago. They serve the Celestial Gods, but are sometimes summoned to this world by the monkey people living on the sacred mountain where the worlds lie closer.
