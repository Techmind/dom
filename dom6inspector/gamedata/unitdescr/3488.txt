The Hidden Order is a secretive order of mages specializing in the magic of glamour and illusions. Their existence is known to few, but their influence is felt by many, for the adepts and masters of the order can be found in many courts whispering half-truths in the ears of unsuspecting lords. The masters of the order are adept glamour mages with some additional skills in air and astral magic. After years of kingmaking and toppling kingdoms they return to their towers to instruct and teach the initiates and adepts of the order.
