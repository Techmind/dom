The Devi of Strength is a huge four-armed divinity brought into existence by a previous Pantokrator to battle a bull demon threatening his nascent world with destruction. The Devi was formed from the flames of the Pantokrator's mouth and was given the mandate and weapons to slay demons. The Devi caught and commanded a divine tiger to carry her in battle with the demon. When the bull demon was vanquished mankind celebrated and begun to worship the Devi as their savior, unaware that she was but a servant of the true Lord. The Pantokrator was furious and imprisoned the Devi for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Devi of Strength is breaking free and is once more worshiped as the Invincible Warrior who will guide and protect mankind.
