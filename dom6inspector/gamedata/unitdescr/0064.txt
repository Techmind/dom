In the Forest of Avalon children are trained and exposed to the magic of the Dreamwild by the Witch Mothers of Avalon. These youngsters develop strength and skills far beyond what should be possible for kids their age. Upon reaching adulthood they are brought to the deepest reaches of the forest to receive their mounts, the legendary Unicorns of Avalon. The sacred Knights of Avalon are clad in the brightest silver and radiate confidence and resolve. Perpetual exposure to the magic of Avalon have granted them unsurpassed prowess and strength, and the mystical power of their mounts protects them from poison, disease and long-lasting battle wounds as well as granting them longevity.
