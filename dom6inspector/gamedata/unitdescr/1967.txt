With the dilution of the True Blood, the pureblood Abysians feared that the old traditions might be lost to the Humanbred population. To preserve the old ways the slayers were incorporated in the sacred caste of the Anathemants and a Slayer Cult was formed. The Slayers were trained as priests and murder was declared a sacred act. The Slayer Sanguine is a prominent priest-assassin trained in the Temple Sanguine. They are taught the secret art of performing blood rituals without the help of blood slaves to sacrifice. Instead they cut themselves and offer their own sacred blood at the risk of their own lives. To increase their chance of staying alive, they are given sacred athames that drain the life force from living beings.
