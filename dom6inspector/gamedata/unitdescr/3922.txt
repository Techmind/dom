Calystri Magistrates wearing yellow robes can be found throughout the republic. They serve as administrative officials, judges and tax collectors. While most Calystri have long since abandoned their uncivilized past there are still a few who have difficulties repressing their aggressive nature. It is the responsibility of the Magistrates to educate the Calystrii and make sure the populace adhere to the Calystri ideal.
