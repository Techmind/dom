The Mages of the Deep are shamblers trained in magic. With time they may grow in size and power and become Kings of the Deep. They are not as powerful as the Kings and rarely venture far from their coral abodes. The Mages of the Deep have the ability to grant water-breathing abilities to a few followers.
