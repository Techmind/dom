The Black Tortoise is a monstrous beast born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power and ordered the world he chose four virtuous beasts and gave them dominion over the four cardinal directions and the corresponding seasons. The Black Tortoise was given mandate over the north and the winter season. But when order settled and the world stabilized mankind forgot the Pantokrator and praised the Black Tortoise for its deeds and magnificence. The Pantokrator was furious and imprisoned the Tortoise in the far north under a blanket of eternal snow. Now with the Pantokrator gone the ice is melting and the Black Tortoise of the North is once more worshiped as the Protector against the calamities of the north.
