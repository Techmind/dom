Pyr√®ne fields two kinds of elite infantry. The Men at Arms protect their lord and are supposed to defend and hold the line in large battles. The Swordsmen on the other hand were developed to counter heavily armored abysian infantry. With their great swords they can maim and kill even fully armored knights.
