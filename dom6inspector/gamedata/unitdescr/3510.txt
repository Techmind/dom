Negiru, the Orchard of Souls, is a Doom Horror, an astral being that feeds on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear. The Orchard of Souls has emerged in the world several times in history and brought destruction and desolation to entire kingdoms. It has strangely distorted perceptions and will primarily attack beings previously marked by Astral magic. Negiru takes the form of several huge skulls fused together around a tainted blaze. Trapped souls sometimes flare in the eye sockets of the abomination. The Orchard of Souls collects the souls of men and use them to germinate and taint the surrounding flora. If left to its machinations orchards of horrible fruit trees will soon start to cover the landscape.
