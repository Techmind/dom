Spirits are central to the beliefs and practices of the Nidings. Jarls and tribal chiefs take precautions to assure the goodwill of their ancestral and totemic spirits. Thus the Seithberenders, niding shamans and spirit guides, have become important and influential in Niding society. The Seithberender Apprentice has not yet mastered seith or shape-shifting and is not allowed to perform any important religious rituals. They have limited magic skills and are not very good researchers.
