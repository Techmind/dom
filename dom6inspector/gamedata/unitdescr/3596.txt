Religion in Pyr√®ne is limited to ancestor worship and veneration of the spiritual forces of the world. Most spiritual matters and religious services are performed by Shamans. They are the ones who inaugurates and blesses the Bebryx. The Shamans are also keepers of traditions and they uphold the ancient pacts with the Jentilak and the Basajaunak. Bekryde shamen have some skills in magic, but are not very good at research. However, their crude labs and shrines are not that expensive.
