In earlier times the soldiers of C'tis mainly used spears. Their role was mainly to hold the line while the slave warriors killed and died. Now, with the predator lizards gone, there is a need for soldiers able to kill heavily armed enemies. Slowly, being an ancient and phlegmatic race, the lizards have adopted to military advances of other nations and crossbow wielding soldiers are increasingly common in the armies of the Lizard Kings.
