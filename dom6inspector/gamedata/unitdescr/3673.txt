Nidavangr society is composed of three totemic clans. The people of the Crow Clan are supposed to be perceptive and wise. The Crow Clan is fully nomadic and freely travels the lands of the other clans, trading and spreading news. Their warriors emulate the tactics of the crow and rarely fight in melee. Instead they prefer to take out their enemies with arrows. Crow Clan archers often accompany Wolf Clan raiders, but rarely raid enemy lands on their own.
