The Veiled Ones are sacred spearmaidens never seen by man nor beast. Sequestered and trained in the Veiled City from a young age the spearmaidens are taught the basics of glamour magic. Not until they are skilled enough to fool their eunuch guards and sneak out of their compound are they allowed to proceed with their training to become Veiled Ones, sacred elite warriors who fight with spear as well as tricks of the mind. The Veiled Ones are rarely spoken of and never seen. Their skills at deception and stealth might even surpass that of the vanir.
