The Nidbathed, Nidlögade, are ghastly warriors who are not even stopped by death. In a horrible ritual administered by the Seithberenders a clan champion is bathed in the black water of the Nidakettil. During the ritual his fellow warriors cut deep wounds in his flesh before taking their own lives. Scarred by both the loss of his friends and the cuts in his flesh, the Nidbathed undergoes a gruesome transformation. His flesh turns white while his scars and eyes turns black as the night. Each scar on his body represents the strength and the death of a friend. If the Nidbathed is killed, one of his scars turns red and he rises again, unkillable as long as his friends’ deaths hold him alive. Being unkillable, the Nidbathed don’t care much for shields. Instead they fight with heavy greatswords able to cut down even the mightiest of Jotuns.
The success of the Nidalögning is dependent on the might of the God and the number of Scar Souls equals half the dominion score of the province.
