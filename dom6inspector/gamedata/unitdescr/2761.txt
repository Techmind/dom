The Onaqui of Xibalba are demonic beings created by the Lords of Death to cause misery and suffering to the living. The oldest and most powerful of the Onaqui  sometimes emerge from the darkest caverns of Xibalba to wreak havoc upon men. Ahalmez is the Sweeping Demon, who hides in the dark and stabs people to death. He often works with Ahaltocob, the Stabbing Demon.
