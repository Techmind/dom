Nidavangr society is composed of three totemic clans. The people of the Wolf Clan are supposed to be social, cunning and aggressive. The Wolf Clan are semi nomadic and rarely settle for long in a given area. They are the ones most likely to raid and pillage enemy lands. Their warriors emulate the tactics of the wolves in battle, fighting with javelins and swords in disciplined packs.
