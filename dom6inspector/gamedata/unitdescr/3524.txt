Unicorns are legendary beings of the Dreamwild. They appear as proud white stallions with a single horn of coral. Their hooves are also of coral and they have a golden mane and beard reminiscent of a goat's. They are sometimes found in wild forests far from civilized men, but are most commonly known to live in the enchanted forest of Avalon where they are trained to be mounts of the fabled Knights of Avalon. The Alicorn, the coral horn of a unicorn, is highly magical and can heal the wounds of its rider as well give him some of his mounts resistance to poison and disease. Unicorns are considered sacred in Man.
