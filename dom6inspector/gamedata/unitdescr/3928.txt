The White Tiger is a monstrous beast born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power and ordered the world he chose four virtuous beasts and gave them dominion over the four cardinal directions and the corresponding seasons. The White Tiger was given mandate over the west and the autumn season. The Tiger led the armies of the Pantokrator against those who would threaten the order of the world, but when order settled and the world stabilized mankind forgot the Pantokrator and praised the White Tiger for its deeds and its magnificence. The Pantokrator was furious and imprisoned the Tiger in the far west with shackles of unbending iron. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Tiger struggle to weaken his eternal bonds and mankind is once more worshiping the White Tiger of the West as the warrior against the threats of this world.
