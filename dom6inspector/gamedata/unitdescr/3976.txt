During the reign of the Prester King, the cynocephalian were primitive tribes of warlike dog-men called upon to fight against the enemies of Ind. With the founding of Andramania and the development of the Calystri ideal most cynocephalians try to forget their past. But in remote lands there are still a few cynocephalians who remember the old ways. Cultivating the worst practices of Gog and Magog, these cynocephalians have degenerated into rabid beasts, avoided by most Calystri. Living as wild beasts they have developed gruesome ritual practices that allow them to feed on the strength of the fallen dead. Called Howlers by the civilized calystrii, they are sometimes paid to fight for the republic in tumultuous times. The gruesome practices of the Howlers are met with disgust and horror and the presence of even a single Howler will reduce the morale of the unit. The Howlers enter battle howling and barking, and few animals dare attack them.
