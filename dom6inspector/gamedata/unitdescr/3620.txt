The Sorginak were once witch-priestesses of the Ancient Ways. Allied with the Jentilak since ancient times they embraced the Bekrydes when these cave-dwellers emerged to the surface world. For centuries they guided the Bekrydes on their endeavors on the surface world. But this changed with the war against Abysia. The giants became fewer and fewer, and with the battle for Pyr√®ne itself the last of the Jentilak died and the Sorginak were scattered and fled from their sacred Mount Anboto. At this time arrived the Akerbeltz, the Black Goats of the woods. Reminiscent of the Pandemoniacs of Pangaea they seduced the Sorginak and initiated them in the use of blood magic. With their newfound powers the Sorginak approached their former allies and offered their services once more. Long lasting exposure to abysian ways had prepared the nation for the gruesome practices of blood magic and the kings and nobles of the kingdom accepted the powers offered by the Sorginak. Now the Sorginak and their dark masters shape the future of the growing kingdom.
The Sorginak have lost some of their powers over storms and the wild, but their tutelage under the Black Goats have made them accomplished blood mages able to call upon infernal powers. They still have the knowledge to make flying ointments and shapeshift.
