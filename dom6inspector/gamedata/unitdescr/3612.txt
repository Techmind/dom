When the Bekrydes left their caves and established a mountain kingdom they adopted the tactics of other human nations. Influenced by Marignon their nobles started to train and use horses for warfare. Now most nobles own horses and fight from horseback. The Pyr√®nian Knights have been a valuable asset in the wars against Abysia, but the horses pose a problem as they are less resilient to heat than their riders. A prudent knight maneuvers to avoid engagement with large groups of the lava-born where his horse would suffer from the blistering heat.
