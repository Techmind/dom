The unseelie fay are beings of the Dreamwild, but sometimes they enter the world in deep forest where civilization has never reached. The fay are generally capricious, aloof and sometimes even cruel; but the unseelie are outright malicious and hostile to mankind. Just like the seelie, the unseelie form mock courts with queens ruling over vassals, soldiers and servants. But where the seelie rule over lush forests blessed with perpetual summer, the unseelie courts rule over frozen forests and hostile winter woods. Unseelie Soldiers are alabaster-skinned warriors wreathed in illusions. They don glittering armors of crystal and ice that tempers in cold lands, and their swords are made of dreamwrought ice. The unseelie are strongly connected to the winter and they are all resistant to cold.
