Unholy rites performed by the Carrion Lords have caused vines and roots to reanimate the sacred bones of black minotaurs. Although being reanimated by vengeful vines their minds are not completely subsumed by their dark god and they still fight with the dark fury of their living counterparts. The unholy power of the Vengeful God has granted the Carrion Furies magical clubs made of wood, vines and beastly remains. Somehow, as if the vengeful woods had a conscious mind, their chests are covered with boards of bark, reminiscent of the cuirasses worn by those who cut down trees.
