When the primordial time ended and the Pantokrator established the order of the world he separated the underworld from the world of the living and placed his servants to guard the border between the dead and the living. The first of these servants was the Ferryman, tasked with bringing the newly dead across a black river on their way to the afterlife. Unable to abandon his task his curiosity and interest in the world from whence the souls of the dead come has grown over the millennia. Now with the Pantokrator gone the old decrees are weakening and the Ferryman is finally free to explore the land of bodied souls, and in his wake come the spirits of the dead.
