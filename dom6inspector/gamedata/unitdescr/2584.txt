Ragha, and Tur before that, is a stratified society. Pure-blooded Turan nobles avoid intermingling with the lower classes. The Turan nobles, Azatan, form a warrior caste of skilled fighters. Since Tur lost contact with Abysia, new forms of battle tactics have evolved. Horses, unusable by pure-blooded Abysians, have become popular and much of the Turan armies are mounted. The Saravan ride the fabled Nisean warhorses. The Savaran are heavily armed mounted elites from the Azatan noble class. They are deployed on the flanks while the War Elephants form the center of an army.
