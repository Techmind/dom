 The Turans ride the fabled Nisean war horses. The Turans are descendants of Abysians, masters of breeding, and when they found the Nisean horses, they bred them to perfection. Bred with demon steeds, they have become stronger and more ferocious than any other breed of horses. Their demonic ancestry also gives them limited resistance to fire.
