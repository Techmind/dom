Criqvoh, the Void Flame, is a Doom Horror, an astral being that feeds on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear. The Void Flame has only emerged once, which happened in quite recent history. Then its appearance resulted in the downfall of a mighty empire. It has strangely distorted perceptions and will primarily attack beings previously marked by Astral magic.
