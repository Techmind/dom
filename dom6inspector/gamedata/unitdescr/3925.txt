The Senators are the highest ranking officials of the republic. Only magistrates that have served years as both presbyters and magii are considered accomplished enough to become senators. The senators enact laws and define the politics of the republic. They rarely leave the senate and when they do, they avoid simple tasks such as tax collecting. On occasion they evaluate a local magistrate, but as a rule they expect local affairs to proceed smoothly without the interference of a senator. The Calystri Senators are powerful mages following the traditions of Magnificent Ind, although they haven't fully mastered the astral magic practiced by the magii of Ind. While most Magistrate Magii are discouraged from practicing nature magic, any such restrictions no longer apply to the senators. Instead they are expected to study the magic of the wild in order to better understand the cynocephalian nature.
