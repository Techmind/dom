Piconye has adopted much of the religious institutions from Magnificent Ind, including their sacred military traditions. Unless ordained as a Bishop it is virtually impossible to advance in the military. For the most part it is the Bishop Generals who command the armies of Piconye, but it is not uncommon for Arch Bishops or Popes to join and take command over army contingents led by lower ranking priests. This is considered a great honor for the commanding Bishop General, and a sure sign that he will be promoted in the upcoming Council of Popes.
