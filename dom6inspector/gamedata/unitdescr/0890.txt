There are three priestly orders in the Machakan society. The highest of these orders is known as the Voices of the Lord. While most of the order speaks the will of the Lord, performing important ceremonies, a few of them are brought to the God Forest to be trained as warrior priests riding huge Hunter Spiders. Their role is to lead the Black Hunters and bring the word of the Lord to the enemies of the faith.
