In the heart of the Andramanian capital there is an entire quarter sealed off from the outside world. In the middle of the compound, surrounded by verdant greenery, lies the Shrine Serene, a place of peace and solace. Here the Serene Ones practice and meditate in silence. The Serene Ones are sacred warriors who have fully adopted the calystri ideal and vowed not to eat flesh of any kind, be it from human or beast. Being dog-men their bodies revolt against their diet and they are weak and frail by cynocephalian standards. However, they are provided for by the presbyter magisters and can spend their waking hours practicing swordplay and meditating in the gardens surrounding the shrine. Their skills in swordplay are unmatched in Andramania. The Serene Ones rarely leave the Shrine Serene and when they do they are commanded by the Serene Masters.
