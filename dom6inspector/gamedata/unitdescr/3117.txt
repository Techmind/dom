The power in Mekone is divided between the Basileus, the Archons and the Polemarchs. The Basileus is the priest-king of the Gigantes. By virtue of might he has claimed his title. Surpassed only by the Elder Cyclopes in magical might the Basileus is also the ceremonial master of the public cult of the god-slayer of Mekone. Revered by his kin and worshiped by humans the Basileus is almost a god in his own right. Once a year he inaugurates a champion of the god-slayer in a purifying bath of water and flames.
