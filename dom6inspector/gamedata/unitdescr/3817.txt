The influence of Magnificent Ind is observable throughout Feminie. Some of the old abbeys that once littered the land might have fallen into disrepair, but there are still active abbeys in the vicinity of most towns and cities of Feminie. Noble ladies who spurn a military career and lack magic abilities often end up in an abbey where they study the lore of Magnificent Ind, be it history, natural science or arcana. Their research has proven to be invaluable to the Sage-Queens.
