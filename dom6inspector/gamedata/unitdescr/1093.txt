Unholy rites performed by the Carrion Lords have caused vines and roots to reanimate the bones of dead Hierophants. The unholy power of the Vengeful God has granted the sagittarian carcass magical weapons made of wood and vines. Anyone hit by their arrows will get entangled and possibly infected by a carrion seed. Sagittarian carcasses are holy to the followers of the Vengeful God.
