Bebryx was the first Bekryde king. He formed an alliance with the Jentilak, unified the Bekrydes and named the caves after his daughter Pyr√®ne. The Bekrydes conquered the mountain range surrounding the cavernous realm and befriended the Basajaunak of the wild forests. Bebryx's name has since been adopted as a title by his successors. The Bebryx is considered sacred by his subjects and share priestly authority with the shamen and the Sorginak. The Bebryx inspires his Bekryde followers to great deeds, but his strategic skills are not exceptional.
