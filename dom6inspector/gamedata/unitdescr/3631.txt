Before arriving in the lands of the Tuatha the Milesians passed through and conquered lands under Marignoni rule. Here they encountered military advancements and traditions developed in the feudal kingdom. When the Milesians were forced to leave they brought these advancements with them in the conquest of Eriu. Men-at-Arms clad in heavy mail armors and swords of iron accompanied and guarded the milesian lords during the conquest. While few in numbers these elite warriors still form an important part of the Milesian armies.
