Magic research in Magnificent Ind was mostly conducted by Abbot Sages in the monasteries scattered throughout the kingdom. With the fall of Ind, Piconye sages ordained as priests have inherited the position of the Abbot Sages and Magii. These Abbot-Priests are far from their fabulous predecessors in magic aptitude, but they are still capable mages that often link their magic in holy communions.
