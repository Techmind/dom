Influenced by Abysia as well as the Akerbeltz and their Sorginak servants, Pyr√®ne has turned into a dark and sinister land. The bishops of the kingdom now leads a bloody cult of human sacrifice and vile magics. While not fully initiated in the Akelarre, many bishops study and practice blood magic in private to further their influence and power. Upon inauguration Bishops must prostrate themselves before the Green-Flame Emerald and expose themselves to its green glare. This shortens their lifespan, but grants heightened magic resistance.
