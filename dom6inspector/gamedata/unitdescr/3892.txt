The Bluecap is a Cave Kobold that recently found its way out of the Dreamwild. As such it has not yet lost its grasp of Earth magic. The true shape of a Bluecap is a dancing blue flame, but it often takes the shape of a Cave Kobold with a bright blue cap when interacting with this world. Many miners place silver in their tunnels hoping that a blue flame might appear and lead them to new veins of metal. Bluecaps, like most fay creatures, are sensitive to iron.
