Piconye is a theocratic monarchy and priests can be found everywhere. Priests and bishops occupy every influential position in Piconye society. Arch Bishops perform important religious services, but they also occupy most high ranking offices. Many Arch Bishops also follow a martial career and are known to suddenly appear and take command over an army contingent from its commanding Bishop General. Since the little men of Piconye formed a kingdom in the image of Magnificent Ind they have discovered that not everyone willingly serves the church and the Awakening God. The Arch Bishops scrutinize the armies of Piconye as well as newly subjugated lands to stifle erroneous thoughts before they can spread and corrupt the righteous.
