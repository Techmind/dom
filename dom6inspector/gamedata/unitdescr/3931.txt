The Vermilion Bird is a monstrous beast born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power and ordered the world he chose four virtuous beasts and gave them dominion over the four cardinal directions and the corresponding seasons. The Vermilion Bird was given mandate over the south and the summer season when everything is bright. But when order settled and the world stabilized mankind forgot the Pantokrator and praised the Vermilion Bird for its deeds and magnificence. The Pantokrator was furious and imprisoned the Bird in the far south in a golden cage with five locks. Now with the Pantokrator gone the locks are opening and the Vermilion Bird of the South can spread its wings and is once more worshiped as the bringer of wealth and good fortunes.
