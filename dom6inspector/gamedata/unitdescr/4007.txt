This tree has been uprooted and awakened by magic. It slowly walks forward on its roots and attacks the enemies of the caster, but will lose agency if left without magic leadership. Even a normal tree that doesn't defend itself takes a long time to chop down, so this one will surely be a challenge to kill.
