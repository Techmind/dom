The Bird Knights are the pride of the Piconye armies. Swift and able to strike far and wide they are employed to launch surprise attacks on enemies and bandits. In olden days Piconye was harassed by strange birds, but after a successful expedition into the wilderness the birds' nests were destroyed and the eggs were collected and brought back to Piconye. Since then the strange birds have been bred for strength and size and now serve as mounts for the Bird Knights.
