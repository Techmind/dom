The Mother of Storms is a giant of divine heritage born in primordial times. She was once given power over all winds and weather by a Previous Pantokrator. During her travels with the winds she met and was courted by a heavenly serpent of flames. The pair mated and the Mother of Storms gave birth to the first storm. Frightened and cowed, the first men began to worship the couple as gods, hoping to be spared from their wrath and receive their blessings. The Pantokrator was furious and imprisoned them under mountains for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the fetters are crumbling and the Mother of Storms will once again engender storms in her cave abode.
