The God Spider is a colossal spider born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. As a creature of unrivaled cunning and a manifestation of sudden demise and life beyond death she was worshiped by the first of men as a god. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he sought out and imprisoned the monsters that would threaten the world. Now with the Pantokrator gone the God spider is breaking free.
