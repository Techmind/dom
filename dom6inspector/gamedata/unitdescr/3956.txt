The jotuns of the frozen lands are allowed to follow their old traditions with subservient Jarls and Herses ruling the land. The religious ceremonies of the Jarlâ€™s personal household and surroundings are the privilege of the Jarl himself, but there are other priests who have greater religious authority. The Gode is a priest and elder knowledgeable in the ancient laws. They perform religious ceremonies as well as arbites in trials at the Thing. Their collective word is sacred and supersedes even that of a Jarl, although this is a rare occurrence, since most Godar are close to their lord. Godar rarely arm themselves for intense fighting, but usually carry a sword and a shield.
