The Crystal Soul is a powerful spirit that inhabits an enormous subterranean crystal. The crystal was found by a subterranean race a long time ago and has been worshiped as the protector of their cavernous realm. The spirit cannot leave the crystal it inhabits, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion and it is also magically powerful. In a physical battle, the crystal would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.
