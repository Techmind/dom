The Prester King is the wise and virtuous ruler of Piconye. Righteous and wise beyond compare he presides at the Council of Popes when they lay down the policies of the  kingdom. In Magnificent Ind there was but one Prester King, but Piconye, according to the Popes, is even more virtuous than its predecessor and there are actually several illustrious Sage-Priests who have been inaugurated as Prester Kings. These kings, being wiser and more humble than any other king, share power and trust the Council of Popes to govern the kingdom. The Prester Kings are also the most adept of all mages in the kingdom and most of them study and practice the magic arts when not required to preside at the Council of Popes. In their infinite wisdom the Popes have made it so that the same Prester King never presides at the Council more than once a year. Thus the Prester Kings can live exalted lives and rarely need to consern themselves with the bothers of worldly affairs. The Prester Kings rarely lead armies and often have limited military experience, but when they do lead armies their soldiers fight with great fervor.
