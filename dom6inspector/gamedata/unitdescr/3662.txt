The Asura is a three-headed and four-armed demon god of ancient times. It is the eternal enemy of the Devatas and Yakshas of Kailasa. The Asura led a rakshasa horde against the blessed ones of Kailasa, intent on their destruction. But then the previous Pantokrator rose to power and ended the war with a single word. The Devatas withdrew from the world and the Rakshasas and their master were banished for eternity. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Asura has returned and once again gathers his rakshasa armies, ready to devour the world.
