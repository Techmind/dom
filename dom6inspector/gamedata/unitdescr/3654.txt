The Weaver of Tales is a trickster and a master of magic. He was possibly the one who led the spider clan to the God Mountain, but it is uncertain if he gained his powers there or if he already had them when the body of the dead god was found. He is believed to be the founder of the order of the Anansis, but information gained from them is rarely trustworthy. Just for the fun of it, he has taken the role of a Pretender God.
