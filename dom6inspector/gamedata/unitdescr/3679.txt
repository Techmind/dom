Spirits are central to the beliefs and practices of the Nidings. Jarls and tribal chiefs take precautions to assure the goodwill of their ancestral and totemic spirits. Thus the Seithberenders, niding shamans and spirit guides, have become important and influential in Niding society. Seithberenders follow their clan totem and their magic skills reflect this. The Seithberenders of the Bear clan are skilled in the arts of fertility and the ground upon which crops grow and animals graze. All Seithberenders are able to transform into the form of their totemic spirit.
