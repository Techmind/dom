The Popes are the highest ranking priests of Piconye, just below the Prester King himself. The Popes congregate at the Cerulean Cathedral where they scrutinize everything that goes on in the kingdom. Every decision made by the administration must go through the oversight of the Popes. Since the little men of Piconye formed a kingdom in the image of Magnificent Ind they have discovered that not everyone willingly serves the church and the Awakening God. The guiding hand of the Popes have become crucial to keep foreign influences and corruption at bay. The Popes, under supervision of the Prester Kings regularly convene in The Council of Popes, laying out plans for the kingdom.
