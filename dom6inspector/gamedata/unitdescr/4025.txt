The Titan Mandragora was a giant of divine heritage once put in charge of the wild by a previous Pantokrator. As lord of beasts, berserkers and wild revelry he became worshiped by the half-men of the wild forests. When mankind tried to drive the half-men from their woodland homes the titan tried to intervene, breaking the decree of the Pantokrator. He was promptly slain by his master and his soul trapped in his mortal remains, overgrown by vines and roots. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the old decrees are weakening and the vengeful soul of the dead Titan is slowly awakening, reanimating his carcass prison and causing the wild woods to stir and wreak vengeance upon a world who would harm the wild.
