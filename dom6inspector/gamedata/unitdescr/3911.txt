Kobolds are small fay creatures from the Dreamwild who occasionally appear on the fringes of civilized lands. There are three kinds of Kobolds: the ones found in households, the ugly and grumpy ones found underground, and the merry ones found on ships. Water Kobolds are friendly and helpful and can be persuaded to aid sailors. Water Kobolds aren't very good leaders, but they can bring soldiers with them across the sea. They appear as small and weathered fishermen in yellow clothes and are usually puffing on a tobacco pipe.
