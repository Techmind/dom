The Muspel Giants are descendants of primordial giants sprung from the lava flows of Muspelheim. They are huge of stature and infused with the might of the everburning flames of Muspelheim. Their skin is black as charcoal and their hair and beards burn like flames. Their bodies radiate intense heat and anyone standing close to them might lose consciousness or catch fire. The Muspel Giants serve as their Jarls' personal guards and are given magical swords made in the lava forges of Muspelheim.
