The Tartalo are pastoral cyclopean giants that tend their flocks of mouflon sheep on the mountain slopes of Pyr√®ne. They are tremendously strong, but rather slow-witted and do not share the metal-working skills of the other pyrenian giants. As a favor to the Sorginak or the Jentilak they sometimes join the armies of the Bekrydes.
