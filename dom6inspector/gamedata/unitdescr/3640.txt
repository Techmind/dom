At the center of the Basalt City there is a gorge at the bottom of which stands an enormous dark crystal in which moving shadows ans sudden flashes of light can be seen. Here the Basalt Kings of Atlantis have gathered for millenia, observing in silence. Once every turning of the churning the Basalt Queens, High Priestesses of the Deep Ones, arrive and circumambulate the crystal in prayer, for this is the God of Atlantis, a spirit of tremendous power inhabiting the Dark Crystal. The spirit cannot leave the crystal it inhabits, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion and it is also magically powerful. In a physical battle, the crystal would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back.
