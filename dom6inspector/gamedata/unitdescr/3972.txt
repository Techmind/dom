The Muspeldottir is a jotun sorceress with skin like charcoal and eyes like burning embers. They are descendants of the Muspel Giants and follow another tradition than the Gygjas of the frozen lands. They have only rudimentary skills in seith, but can channel the fiery power of Muspelheim. While the oldest and mightiest of the Muspelgygjas rarely leave Muspelheim, the Muspeldottirs serve their lords as envoys and counselors to the jotun jarls of the frozen lands. As carriers of their masters' will their influence has gradually come to outgrow that of the jotun gygjas.
