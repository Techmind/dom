The Emerald knights are sacred knights riding Great Mouflons into battle. Once these great sheep grazed on the slopes of the Pyrènian mountains, herded by the Tartalo giants that once inhabited the lands. With the disappearance of the Tartalo men caught and domesticated the mouflons and found them to be strong and reliable mounts. A few prominent families fielded knights mounted on armored mouflons. During the battle against the great Abysian army the mouflon knights were instrumental to the victory. Traveling unhindered through mountain passes and over ridges they surprised and defeated the abysian command, and captured the Green-Flame Emerald from the abysian warlord. They were declared blessed by the Archbishop himself and a knightly order of mouflon knights was formed. Like most Pyrènians the Emerald Knights are of Bekryde descent, strong and resilient to the elements, but their mounts are less so. While native to the cold mountain tops, they are not resistant to heat and flames.
