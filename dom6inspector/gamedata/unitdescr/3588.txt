Bekrydes are primitive cave dwelling humans. With the founding of the Pyr√®ne kingdom Bebryx, the first Bekryde king, formed an alliance with the Jentilak and the Basajaun, giants skilled in metalcrafting. Metal has since become more common in the cavernous kingdom, but many Bekrydes still fight with weapons and armors of leather and stone. Bekrydes are strong by human standards, and resilient to the elements. They also have limited darkvision, but poor eyesight. They are somewhat susceptible to magic and rely on their shamans to protect them from malign spirits.
