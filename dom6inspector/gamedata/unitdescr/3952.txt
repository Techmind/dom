A God Lich is the dried husk of a Titan adept in Death magic that has performed the Lichcraft ritual on himself. The Titan removes his viscera and hides it in an urn outside his body, taking his own life in the process. Upon completing the ritual the Titan becomes an immortal Lich with increased understanding and powers of death magic. Should the body of the God Lich be physically destroyed, a new one is formed from the dust of the dead.
