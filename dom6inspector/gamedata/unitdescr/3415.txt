Since they first allied themselves with the Gygjas of Jotunheim the Vaettir has used mooses as mounts. In this age the moose rider is equipped with a crossbow and wears a chain cuirass, while his co-rider uses a bow and wears a simple leather armor. Moose riders are fast and can quickly travel long distances even through dense forests. If archers are needed in a vaetti raiding party moose riders are sure to be included.
