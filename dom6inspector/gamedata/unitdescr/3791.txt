Piconye has adopted much of the religious institutions from Magnificent Ind, including their sacred military traditions. The most virtuous of the soldier priests are the Baculus-wielding Baculites. The Baculus is a sacred staff imbued with the righteous might of the awakening god. Heretics struck by the staff will find themselves stunned by divine might. The Baculites are employed to deal with especially troublesome enemies, ghosts and heretics.
