The alchemists of Marignon have, with the possible aid of infernal tutors, devised means to fuse human bodies with elemental essence. The Alchemical amalgam of fire is a living amalgam of flesh and fire. Amalgams of Fire are strong and skilled fighters highly resistant to fire. When killed the elemental essence contained in their bodies erupts in a fiery explosion.
