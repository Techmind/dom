The Equites of the Sacred Shroud are led by ordained priests of the Sacred Shroud trained as cavalry commanders. They command the sacred equites and bless their shrouds in battle, but they rarely perform other religious services. Their role is to bring ruin to the enemies of the faith, and not to comfort the masses.
