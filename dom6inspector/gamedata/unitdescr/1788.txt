The Fir Bolg once inhabited the realms now known as Eriu and Man. They were subjugated by the Tuatha and served as farmers and warriors for that race. With the coming of man, their masters withdrew from the world and most of the Fir Bolg were slain. A few of them still remain in the highlands of the new kingdom, marginalized and resentful of their lot. For centuries the clans have preserved their traditions, raiding cattle and fighting among themselves. With the arrival of the awakening God they have joined their Milesian masters to fight for God and glory.
