Angels are divine beings in human form. They are winged and dressed in white robes. Angels sing praises to the Lord and will automatically join an arcane chorus as chorus slaves. They are difficult to harm with mundane weapons and are surrounded by a radiant aura that intimidates cowardly beings. Angels have partial resistance to lightning and fire.
