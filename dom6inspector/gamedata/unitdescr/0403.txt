The horned serpent, Cerastes, is an enormous, venomous serpent with thick scales. It gets its name from the horns on its head. The Cerastes is most commonly found in sandy deserts where it hides beneath the sand, with only the horns exposed. Their prey is deceived into thinking the horns are edible and when they approach the serpent springs forth and swiftly kills the animal.
