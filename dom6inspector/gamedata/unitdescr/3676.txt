Nidavangr society is composed of three totemic clans. The people of the Bear Clan are supposed to be strong, calm and prudent. They are more inclined to defend their settlements than to raid and pillage. Their warriors emulate the tactics of the bear in battle, donning heavy armors and axes. Like the bear they become enraged when wounded. The bear is a solitary being and the bear clan warriors fight alone and are not as disciplined as the wolf clan warriors.
