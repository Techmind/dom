Andramania is a nascent republic of civilized cynocephalians. While the rulers and upper echelons of Andramanian society are virtuous and righteous, there is still a considerable portion of the population who by human standards could be called uncivilized. Andramanians who serve in the militia tend to be less organized and more prone to violence than the calystri ideal would suggest.
