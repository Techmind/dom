In Asphodel every aspect of life, and death, is permeated by the dark rage of the Vengeful God. In Pangaea, white centaurs are rare and white minotaurs even more so, but in Asphodel the influence of the Vengeful God has brought about an increasing number of minotaurs blessed with black hides and a matching temper. Trained as sacred warriors they mete out the vengeance of the Awakening God.
