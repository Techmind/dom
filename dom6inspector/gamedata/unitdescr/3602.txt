The mountains of Pyr√®ne were once inhabited by primordial giants who erected huge stone monuments that now litter the peaks and valleys of the land. The giants were skilled smiths and craftsmen and taught the first men how to work metal. When the wheel of time turned and the primordial age ended they entered their dolmens and withdrew from the surface world. But they kept an eye on their chosen and have never abandoned the Bekrydes. They humbly serve and guide the Bekryde Kings with advice, ancient magic and their incomparable strength. The Jentilak are huge of stature, mighty mages of earth and skilled craftsmen. They are sacred to the Bekrydes, but are not actual priests.
