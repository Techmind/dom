The Soultorn are the blackened remains of someone whose soul has been shattered and distorted by a powerful Horror of the Void. The body of a Soultorn will continue to fight even when it is broken and shattered, its twisted flesh reformed by energies of the Void. The Soultorn has lost all remnants of humanity and has become a Horror in every aspect. Horrors are astral beings that feed on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear. They have strangely distorted perceptions and will primarily attack creatures previously marked by Astral magic. Horrors sometimes appear in highly magical countries to attack people who have been marked by evil Astral mages. Soultorns are often the first horrors to appear in tainted lands and their appearance is often interpreted as a sign that evil times are nigh.
