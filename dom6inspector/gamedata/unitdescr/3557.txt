On the cloudy peaks of Mount Cephalos and a few other remote locations, pegasi can still be found. The pegasi are magnificent winged, white steeds, reputedly sprung from the blood of a slain divinity in ancient times. Pegasi are sacred to most peoples, but only the crystal amazons and the priestesses of Arcoscephale have managed to capture and tame the noble steeds.
