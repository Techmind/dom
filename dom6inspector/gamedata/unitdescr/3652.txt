In the God Mountain resides the true power of Machaka. Here, Sorcerers of great power practice dark magic. There are three orders of mages trained in the deep caverns underneath the Mountain. Of these the Anansis are the most enigmatic. They collect stories and tales and weave them into half-truths for the gullible masses. Their stories spread unrest and even distrust in the faith of the awakening God. They are viewed with suspicion by the Voices of the Lord and are often asked to leave cities and other settlements when discovered. Their skills in information gathering however, is unrivaled and they are sometimes found working together with the Ears of the Lord. Anansis are able to transform into great spiders at will. They lose some magic skills when in spider form.
