A God Lich is the dried husk of a Titan adept in Death magic that has performed the Lichcraft ritual on herself. The Titan removes her viscera and hides it in an urn outside her body, taking her own life in the process. Upon completing the ritual the Titan becomes an immortal Lich with increased understanding and powers of death magic. Should the body of the God Lich be physically destroyed, a new one is formed from the dust of the dead.
