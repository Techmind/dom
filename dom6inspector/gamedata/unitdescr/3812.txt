Since the time of Magnificent Ind, women hold power in Feminie. Rulers, sages and military commanders are all female. Feminie Lady Commanders are Lady Knights promoted by the queens and entrusted to lead armies of the hidden queendom. Although skill and experience plays a part in advancing one's career, Feminie is an isolated feudal society where status and influence often is more important than actual battle experience when commanders are chosen.
