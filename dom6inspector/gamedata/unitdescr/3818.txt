There are still numerous abbeys of Magnificent Ind littering the landscape of Feminie. These abbeys are deposits of the arcane and natural lore discovered and developed by the Abbot-Magii of Magnificent Ind. The Abbesses direct and organize research into the old lore of Ind and present it to their Sage-Queens. The discoveries and research of the Abbeys have helped Feminie in its rise as an independent magocracy.
