The leader of the Bear Clan Seithberenders is strong and wise. He is a powerful mage of nature and fertility and has reputedly sired two dozen brave sons. His skill as a warrior is equally good and he is known to enter a wild rage when fighting. When he single-handedly defeated a jotun raiding party attacking a small settlement he was recognized as the strongest of the Bear Clan Seithberenders and became the next Seithmathr of the clan.
