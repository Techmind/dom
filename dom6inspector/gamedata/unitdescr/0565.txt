There are many myths about huge monsters emerging from the depths to attack ships and devour those on board. The sea serpent is perhaps the most feared of these monsters. It is a huge, underwater serpent with coral spines sprouting from its back. Its fangs are highly poisonous, but it is its coral horn that has made it famous. Just like the alicorn sprouting from the forehead of the unicorn, the coral horn of the Sea Serpent is inherently magical.
