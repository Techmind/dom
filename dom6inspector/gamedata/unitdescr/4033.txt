The Worm Soul is the remains of an Arch Mage adept in Nature Magic that was slain in the dark woods of Asphodel. When the worms and bugs that feed on carrion devoured the corpse, part of the soul merged with the vengeful will of the Carrion Woods transferring its mind and power into the crawling mass feeding on the remains. The writhing mass of worms and bugs houses the life force of the dead mage, but its will and goals have been subsumed by that of the Vengeful Woods. Should the Worm Soul be slain in combat, its body will dissolve into a myriad of bugs that will still contain the life force of the mage. If left undisturbed it will not take long for the writhing mass to reform. The Worm Soul can enter the sea and when doing so it will simply make use of shrimps and other underwater bugs instead of the usual beetles and worms.
