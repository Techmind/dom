Falconry is a popular pastime activity among the noblesse of Marignon and most nobles have a falconeer to care for his falcons. Occasionally falconeers employ their birds in warfare and train them to attack humans. The falcons can rarely hurt armored soldiers, but they can harass enemy archers and mages.
