The Azure Dragon is a monstrous beast born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power and ordered the world he chose four virtuous beasts and gave them dominion over the four cardinal directions and the corresponding seasons. The Azure Dragon was given mandate over the east and the spring season when everything grows. But when order settled and the world stabilized mankind forgot the Pantokrator and praised the Azure Dragon for its deeds and magnificence. The Pantokrator was furious and buried the Dragon in the far east under an eternally growing tree. Now with the Pantokrator gone the roots of the tree are shifting and moving and and the Azure Dragon of the East is once more worshiped as the bringer of growth and good births.
