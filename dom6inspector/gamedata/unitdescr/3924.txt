While most Calystri mages share their insights and skills with the administration, they are not required to do so by law. Since many Calystri Magii practice their magic arts independently, the republic have decided that there is a need for loyal mages dedicated to the prosperity of the republic. Magistrate Magii receives arcane studies in the capital. Magic studies are time consuming and the Magister Magii are allowed to limit their administrative studies. Their focus differ a bit from regular Calystri Magii and they are encouraged not to practice the wild magic of nature. As Magistrates they are considered sacred in the republic.
