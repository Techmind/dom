The Hidden Order is a secretive order of mages specializing in the magic of glamour and illusions. Their existence is known to few, but their influence is felt by many, for the masters of the order can be found in many courts whispering half-truths in the ears of unsuspecting lords. The initiates of the order have some basic skills in the manipulation of illusions and have yet to be released upon the world.
