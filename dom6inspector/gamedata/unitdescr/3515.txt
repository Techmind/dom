War horses are trained not to spook in battle. They are equipped with barding of leather or metal. Cavalry reliant on a lance charge often ride war horses with heavier armor. Some war horses are also trained to fight with their hooves while their rider swings his weapon. War Horses are bred to be stronger than riding horses, but are somewhat slower.
