Float Cat Horrors are strange beings sprung from the Void. They appear as ethereal, floating cat carcasses with fleshy tentacles protruding from where the head should have been. The horror feeds on life force and reinvigorates itself when it successfully strikes a target. Float Cat Horrors are not of this world and they can reverse the laws of cause and effect. Anyone striking the horror might take damage themselves instead.
