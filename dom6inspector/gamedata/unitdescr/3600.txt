In the wild forests of Pyr√®ne, far from any human settlements, live wild men of great stature. Older than mankind, these giants taught the first men how to toil the land and work metal. While not as skilled smiths as the Jentilak the Basajaunak are still superior to most human craftsmen. Basajaunak are solitary beings who live their lives in solitude or in married pairs. They mostly avoid contact with mankind, but they are allied with the Bekrydes and would not hesitate to help their little friends should they be attacked. Male Basajaunak are primarily skilled in earth magic. They rarely wear any clothes but their bodies are covered by dense fur. The Basajaunak are sacred to the Bekrydes, but they do not wield any priestly powers.
