Phantasmal Steeds are beings of the Dreamwild, made of memories, dreams and legends. They surpass ordinary horses in every way, but are not real. However, they can interact with creation if conjured with glamour magic. They are insubstantial and difficult to harm with physical weapons. Phantasms cannot hold on to reality for long and will disperse when the battle is over.
