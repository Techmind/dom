Failed Reborn aspirants are given the choice to become Tomb Flame Wielders, sacred crossbowmen able to harness the flames of the Bane Fires. Already trained in basic magic arts they are allowed to enter the tombs and learn the secrets of the Tomb Flames. Then they are given enchanted crossbows and taught how to conjure banefire and ignite the bolts of their crossbows with its greenish flame. Due to repeated exposure to the banefire glare the Tomb Flame Wielders age and become pale and shriveled. The Tomb Flame Wielders are held in high esteem, but few C'tissians would trade lots with them.
Banefire Crossbows are deadly, but slow weapons. Once loaded the specially prepared bolt must be ignited by magic before the crossbow can be fired.
