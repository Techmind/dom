Gygjas are ancient Jotun hags. Over the centuries, they have grown in might and malice. The Gygjas of the frozen lands are skilled in the dark witchcraft known as Seith and they can foretell the future. Seith is a magic forbidden to men and only used by female Jotuns. The Gygjas of Muspelheim have found themselves increasingly replaced by the Muspeldottirs which has led to some resentment between the two groups. They are now less influential than their sisters in Niefelheim, but since their skill in seith is far superior to that of the Muspeldottirs, their influence is still considerable. Their masters are not interested in reawakening the Rimtursar and the Gygjas of Muspelheim have sworn not to call the Illwinter.
