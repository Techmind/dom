Bebryx, the first king, formed an elite force of sacred warriors blessed with the magic of the Jentilak and the Bekryde Cave Shamans. They are equipped with swords and armors of iron. Their role is first as bodyguards of the Bebryx, but as the most skilled warriors of the kingdom, contingents of Bebryx Guards sometimes end up in armies far from their kingâ€™s presence.
