Andramania is a nascent republic of civilized cynocephalians. While the rulers and upper echelons of Andramanian society are virtuous and righteous, there is still a considerable portion of the population who by human standards could be called uncivilized. Calystri City Guards are chosen for their cool and their unwavering adherence to the calystri ideal. They are especially good at calming unruly subjects, be they cynocephalians or humans. They are also drilled in fort defence.
