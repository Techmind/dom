The Bear is known to be nurturing and protective of its young. While the young of Nidavangr are exposed to life threatening hardship before coming of age, the cubs of the Bear Clan are less likely to die at an early age. Despite some disdain from the other clans they are protected and guided by the Cub-Mothers, Bear Clan war-nurses. The Cub-Mothers teach the young how to survive beyond their childhood and sometimes lead Cub-Warriors in their first battles. Cub-Mothers are not very good tacticians, but they are used to handle unruly youngsters and have an affinity for organizing the cub-warriors into units.
