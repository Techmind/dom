The Presbyter is a lowly parish priest. They handle everyday ceremonies and religious services. The importance of religion is secondary to the administration in Andramania. For the most part the Presbyters are left to their own devices, but occasionally a Presbyter Magistrate arrives to oversee the performance of the Presbyter.
