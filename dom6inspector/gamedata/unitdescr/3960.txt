The Muspelgygja is an old jotun hag with skin like charcoal and eyes like burning embers. Gygjor in general are jotun hags adept at the dark art of Seith who serve the jotun jarls with their foresight and advice. Muspelgygjor, descendants of the Muspel Giants, are of another tradition and have only rudimentary skills in seith. Instead they command the fires and flames of their fiery home. Their skills in fire magic is only rivaled by the Anathemants of Abysia and the Muspel Jarls themselves.
