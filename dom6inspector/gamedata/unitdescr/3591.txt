Bekrydes are primitive cave dwelling humans. With the founding of the Pyr√®ne kingdom Bebryx, the first Bekryde king, formed an alliance with the Jentilak and the Basajaun, giants skilled in metalcrafting. Metal has since become more common in the cavernous kingdom. Bekryde infantry don light metal armors and use iron tipped spears.
