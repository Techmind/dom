The Seithberenders of the Crow Clan are undisputedly the most powerful mages in Nidavangr. Taking the shape of the Crow they travel wide and far to gather and deliver information, give advice to Jarls and Herses and guide the Seithberenders of the other clans. In all but name they are the masters of Nidavangr. The Crow Clan Seithberenders were taught the art of Seith as well as the means to pierce the illusions of the Vanir by their God, and for centuries they have kept vigil against the trickeries of the Vanir. But there is a darker and more sinister side to their power, for it is they who perform the rite of Nidl√∂gning, the Nidbath. Through this horrible ritual several Niding warriors sacrifice themselves to empower the target of the ritual, giving him their lives so that he can live many times over. The Crow Clan Seithberenders are powerful mages of death and the night skies, and some of them practice blood magic.
