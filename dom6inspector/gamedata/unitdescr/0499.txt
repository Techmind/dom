When the Devatas and Yakshas of Kailasa were forced to leave the world, their Lord was trapped. Now the Nataraja is free once again to dance the eternal Dance of Death and Birth. The Nataraja wields an apotropaic trident and burning fires to smite the rakshasas and the wicked of this world. The Nataraja is surrounded by an aura of celestial fire.
