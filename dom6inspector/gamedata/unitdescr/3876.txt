The Sacred Geyser is a powerful spirit that inhabits a hot spring. The spirit cannot leave the spring, but it occasionally lets its will be known by spewing forth hot water. It can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion and it is also magically powerful. In a physical battle, the spring would be almost impossible to destroy, even though it cannot strike back. The Sacred Geyser is completely immobile and cannot move even by magic.
