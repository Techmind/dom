In the Forest of Avalon children are trained and exposed to the magic of the Dreamwild by the Witch Mothers of Avalon. These youngsters develop strength and skills far beyond what should be possible for kids their age. Most of them are trained as mounted knights riding unicorns, but the most talented of them receive further blessings and are trained to become Wardens of Avalon, sacred guardians of the Witches. They wear green cloaks over full chainmail armor and wield great swords. The Wardens are exceptional warriors infused with the strange magic of Avalon to give them unequaled strength, morale and longevity, and they can see through the veils of glamour. Rumor has it that they are descendants of the Tuatha.
