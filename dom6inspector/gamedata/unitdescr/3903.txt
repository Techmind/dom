The fay are beings of the Dreamwild, but sometimes Fay Folk enter the world in deep forest where civilization has never reached. They mimic the dreams and legends of mankind and form mock courts with queens ruling over vassals, soldiers and servants. Fay Footmen are alabaster-skinned warriors wreathed in illusions. They don shimmering armors of crystal and mother of pearl and their swords are made of dreamwrought glass.
