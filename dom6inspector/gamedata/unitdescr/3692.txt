At the dawn of time, monsters and giants roamed the world. Among the beasts was a Great Stag that emerged from the primal forests of the nascent world. As a creature of the wild it was worshiped by the first of men as a god of the hunt. When the previous Pantokrator rose to power he hunted the stag and imprisoned it in the forest from which it came. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles are weakening and the Stag can once more inspire men to hunt.
