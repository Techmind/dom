The Milesians conquered the land of the Tuatha together with the men of Man. While Man captured Avalon, the Milesians tried to conquer Tir na n'Og, the Land of the Ever Young. Unfortunately, the Tuatha left this world with all their secrets and lore. Even with the return of the tuatha the milesian mages were barred from the secrets of the ever-young, and so they still follow their old arcane traditions of the land and the sky.
