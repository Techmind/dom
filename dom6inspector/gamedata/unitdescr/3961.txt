The Muspel Jarls are the oldest and most powerful of the Muspel Giants. From their halls of blackened iron they rule the valley of fire and ash, guided by the wisdom of the Muspelgygjas. The Muspel Jarls are powerful wielders of fire magic, but they also have some skills in death and air magic. They wield flaming blades and charred shields made in the lava forges of Muspelheim. Like all Muspel Giants they radiate heat and become stronger in warm lands.
