Destriers are heavy war horses of exceptional breeding and training. They are  almost exclusively used by knights. Destriers are very expensive and they are always equipped with the best available armor. Destriers are trained to fight with their hooves while their rider swings his weapon. They are bred to be strong and heavy and are not as fast as regular war horses or riding horses.
