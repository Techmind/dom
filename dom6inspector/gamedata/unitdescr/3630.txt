Marginalized in Eriu society the Fir Bolg mainly fight other clans and raid their cattle. They are a passionate race, subjugated by other races in turn, and they have harbored resentment and rage for centuries. Fir Bolg Cattle Raiders are elite warriors and champions who channel their rage and resentment and unleash it in battle to enter a frenzied battle rage. This might not keep them alive, but they will not give up and will attack with increased ferocity and strength.
