Most of the jotuns living in Muspelheim are descendants of the Muspel Giants. Like the jotuns of the frozen lands they are not nearly as powerful as their ancestors. There are no Jarls among the lesser jotuns in Muspelheim, only Herses. These are local chiefs of the lesser jotuns of Muspelheim. They often command their own personal guard of Huskarls, but sometimes lead armies when no Muspel Jarl is present. The Herse is a religious leader in his own household, and coming from Muspelheim proper, has greater religious authority than the Herses of the frozen lands outside Muspelheim.
