Starspawns are ancient Illithids of tremendous power. Most remember the day when the Star fell and the City of R'lyeh was built. With the manifestation of the dreamlands the Starpawns have turned their eldritch arts towards the dreaming minds of their lands. They are masters of Astral magic and are adept at glamour magic. Some carry priestly authority and all are masters of the mind. All Illithids are amphibious and able to use a mind blast attack in battle.
