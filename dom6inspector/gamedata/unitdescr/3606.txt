Throughout the caverns of Pyr√®ne strange beasts live. Some of these have been domesticated by the Bekrydes and serve as livestock and beasts of burden. Nowadays the Bekrydes have colonized lands beyond their caves, but Blind Goats and Cave Cows are still important for the troglopastoral society of the Bekrydes. Cave Cows are somewhat aggressive and can be trained by Bekryde Shepherds to be used in battle. While in a cave a Bekryde Shepherd can capture and train Cave Cows.
