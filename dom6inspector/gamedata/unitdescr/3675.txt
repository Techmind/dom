In the perpetual war even the young must fight for survival. Cub-Warriors are young Nidings who have not yet come of age. Each of them is given a fur, a weapon and an obligation to kill. Until they have slain they are shunned and are not allowed to enter any settlement. If they survive they are allowed to return to society and are fully accepted by their clan. Cub-Warriors have a will to prove themselves and refuse to break in combat. Being young and receptive to coaxing it is quite common for Cub-Warriors to be persuaded or coerced to give their lives in the horrible ritual known as Nidal√∂gning.
