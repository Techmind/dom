The Horror Mantis is a lesser horror formed and tempered by some greater being from beyond the veil. It resembles a huge pitch black mantis with strangely alluring eyes. Its carapace is harder than steel, but it is a swift hunter that strikes with incredible speed. Horrors are otherworldly beings that feed on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear. They have strangely distorted perceptions and will primarily attack creatures previously marked by Astral magic. Horrors sometimes appear in highly magical countries to attack people who have been marked by evil Astral mages.
