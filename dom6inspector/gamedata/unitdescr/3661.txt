The Elephant Idol is a huge golden elephant statue on wheels, that has come to life from being worshiped for many hundreds of years. It is mostly pushed around by worthy followers, but sometimes move around on its own accord, crushing heretics as well as the occasional adherent of the Faith. It is mindless and mostly does what its worshipers believe it would do.
