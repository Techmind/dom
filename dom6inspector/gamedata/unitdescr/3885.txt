Blotrafn is the current Seithmathr of the Crow clan. In his younger years he traveled into the lands of the vanir and found the remains of Helhalla where the Hangadrotts once reigned. He entered three royal mounds and wrested dark secrets from their inhabitants before returning to Nidavangr with deeper knowledge of the dead than any of his peers. When his predecessor suddenly passed away Blotrafn, as expected, took his place as master of the order.
