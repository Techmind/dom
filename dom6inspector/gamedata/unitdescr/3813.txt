When Magnificent Ind fell some of its magical secrets were adopted by Feminie and the queens turned their queendom into a magocracy. Mages were given status and influence and soon became the ruling class. But the Sage-Queens didn't just want powerful mages, but a corpus of arcane lore to be shared by all mages in the queendom. In Feminie dedicated magical research is as important as improving your own magic power. The Savants of Feminie are curious and inquisitive students of the arcane who have turned their skills to magical research rather than personal empowerment.
