The counts are prominent nobles close to the king. Some of them follow a martial career and join the sacred order of the Emerald Knights. The Emerald Counts are ordained priests who have basked in the light of the Green-Flame Emerald. The exposure to the sacred flame gives increased magic resistance but shortens the lifespan of the initiate. They lead the Emerald Knights and bless them during battles.
