Under the influence of the Void, people dream of strange and mind-defying places. The otherworldly Dreams are so clear, yet strange, that the Dreamers are unaware they are dreaming. Trapped in these strange Dreamlands, the sleeping refuse to wake up and eventually they transcend reality and merge with the void to become manifest dreams of insanity. Void dreamers are ethereal beings without need for physical sustenance. They feed on the dreams of R'lyeh and patiently wait for a Void Herald to lure them or herd them into undreaming lands.
