The Calystrii of Andramania have long since abandoned the shamanistic practices of the cynocephalian shamen of old. With the fall of Ind, calystri mages claimed the ancient lore of the Magnificent kingdom. Calystri Magii now practice arts similar to that of the Magii of Ind, but they have an affinity for the path of nature rather than the more esoteric path of astral magic. While everyone knows that the Calystrii have abandoned the old ways, there are reputedly a few Calystri Mages who have dabbled in the wicked practices of old.
