Kobolds are small fay creatures from the Dreamwild who occasionally appear on the fringes of civilized lands. There are three kinds of Kobolds: the ones found in households, the ugly and grumpy ones found underground, and the merry ones found on ships. Cave Kobolds are surprisingly strong. They are well versed in mining and have exceptional knowledge of where to find veins of metal. If given gold they can aid miners and underground workers. Cave Kobolds are also efficient sappers, should they be used in sieges. Being fay creatures they are sensitive to iron and can use glamour to hide their true appearances. Cave Kobolds use enchanted pick axes to mine or attack perceived threats.
