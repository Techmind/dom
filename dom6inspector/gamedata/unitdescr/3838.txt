Bekrydes are primitive cave dwelling humans. They are strong by human standards, and resilient to the elements. They also have limited darkvision, but poor eyesight. While most Bekrydes live in the kingdom of Pyr√®ne there are some who live independent lives in remote caverns. These Bekrydes still fight with primitive weapons and armors of leather and furs.
