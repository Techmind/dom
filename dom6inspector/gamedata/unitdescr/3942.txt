A Lich Hag is the dried husk of a powerful Gygja that has performed the Lichcraft ritual on herself. The Gygja removes her viscera and hides it in an urn outside her body, taking her own life in the process. Upon completing the ritual the Gygja becomes an immortal Lich with increased understanding and powers of death magic. Should the body of the Lich be physically destroyed, a new one is formed from the dust of the dead.
