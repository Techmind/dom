Ohya, Second Son of Semyaza, is the Firstborn and progenitor of the Giants of the Lost Tribes. In ancient times these giants were bound to their wasteland by a divine decree, lest they overtake the world. The Prester King of Ind, in his infinite wisdom, kept the decree and forbade anyone from entering the land. Now, with the Prester King gone the sorceresses of Feminie have traveled to the forsaken wasteland of the Lost Tribe and parlayed with the Firstborn of the Lost. With their remarkable skills in glamour magic the Sage-Queens devised the means to circumvent the divine Decree. Ohya was given a crown that recreates the conditions of the time before the decree was enforced. In return for his freedom they procured his loyalty to Feminie and the Awakening God. As long as he carries the crown Ohya will not suffer from the curse and is able to leave his home.
Ohya is the Second Son of Semyaza, one of the Lords of Civilization. His physical and magical might rival that of gods.
