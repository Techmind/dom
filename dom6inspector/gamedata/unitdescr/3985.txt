A Phantasmal Knight is a being of the Dreamwild, made of memories, dreams and legends. Phantasms are not real, but can interact with creation if conjured with glamour magic. Phantasmal Knights are manifest dreams of heroic knights armed in shining armor. They are insubstantial and difficult to harm with physical weapons. Phantasms cannot hold on to reality for long and will disperse when the battle is over.
