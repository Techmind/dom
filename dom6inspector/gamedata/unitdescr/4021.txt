A lich is the husk of an Agarthan Oracle adept in Death magic that has performed the Lichcraft ritual on himself. The caster removes his viscera and hides it in an urn outside his body, taking his own life in the process. Upon completing the ritual the caster becomes an immortal Lich with increased understanding and powers of death magic. Should the body of the lich be physically destroyed, a new one is formed from the dust of the dead.
