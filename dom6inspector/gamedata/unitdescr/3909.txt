Unseelie Princes are powerful fay beings mimicking human princes of legendary battle prowess. They appear as immaculate knights with alabaster-pale skin and silver locks, wreathed in icy winds and illusions. Their faces are not beautiful as the Fay Princes of the summer courts. Instead they look cold and cruel with mirthful grins and icy stares. Like their seelie counterparts they consider themselves to be beautiful beyond compare and refuse to use helmets out of unbridled vanity.
