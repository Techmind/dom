Nidavangr is ruled by Jarls, high chiefs of the clans. There is no central authority, but the Jarls follow the guidance of the Seithberenders and often join forces when raiding the lands of the vanir and jotuns. Constant conflicts have made the Nidajarls skilled generals, although they rarely command great numbers. They are worldly leaders and religious affairs are left entirely to the Godes and Seithberenders.
