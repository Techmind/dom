With this enchantment, population living inside the Pretender's Dominion will quickly die and the carcasses will be reanimated by living plants. In forests, animals will be reanimated to join the forces of Pangaea when they die their natural deaths. A growth scale yields better reanimation and Pangaean forest temples may reanimate more powerful creatures.
