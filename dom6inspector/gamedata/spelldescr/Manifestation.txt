With this spell, an Ashen Angel is summoned with the promise of an opportunity to kill a commander in this realm and to bring his soul back to the Lord of the Netherworld. The Ashen Angel will appear in a province of the mage's choice and search for a suitable commander. If no suitable commander is found, the Angel will return to the mage and kill him instead. A commander who is horror marked runs a greater risk of being chosen by the Angel.
