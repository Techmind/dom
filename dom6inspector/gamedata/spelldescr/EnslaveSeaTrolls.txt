An Aboleth Mind Lord extends his mind to locate and attract a group of Sea Troll Warriors. The trolls leave their king in the belief that they will gain fame and glory. When they arrive at the domains of the Aboleths the Mind Lord invades their minds and binds them into permanent servitude. Slave trolls were once guardians at their Sea King's court and come equipped with armaments of shells and corals.
