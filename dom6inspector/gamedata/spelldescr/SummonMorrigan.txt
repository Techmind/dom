The caster summons one of the Morrigans in an attempt to turn the tide of the battle. The Morrigans are heralds of death, collectors of souls and bringers of strife. They are the fates of the battleground, weaving looms of entrails with arrows for shuttles. Their chant colors the skies red before battle. In the shapes of crows they pick out the eyes of the dead. The Morrigans are horrible beings of death and destruction. They appear as grisly warrior women armed with spears enchanted to kill. They are sacred to the Fomorians.
