All forests will start to whisper the hymns to the pretender that controls this enchantment. This will spread dominion to the places where false pretenders were worshiped. When a forest has the right dominion it will start to attack instead of whispering hymns. Enemies in that province or neighboring provinces will be attacked by creatures of the awakening forest.
