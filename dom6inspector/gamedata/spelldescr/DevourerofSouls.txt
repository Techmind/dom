According to the legends of C'tis, the Devourer of Souls sat at the foot of the God's throne. The God of C'tis would tell him the names of sinners and the beast would hunt them down. Once the Devourer bites, the unlucky target's soul is gone and this attack cannot be resisted. The Devourer is a sacred being and with this spell, he can once more take his place at the foot of the God's throne.
