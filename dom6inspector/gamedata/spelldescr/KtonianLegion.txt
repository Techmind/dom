The Ktonian Necromancers of Agartha use the dead in many ways. Soulless bodies toil and fight for their masters. Corpses are strengthened with iron parts and armed with short blades. These Iron Corpses are quite robust, but lack the skills of living soldiers. This spell creates a legion of these living Iron Corpses.
