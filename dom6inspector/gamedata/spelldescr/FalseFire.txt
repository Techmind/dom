This spell resembles the normal fireball, but the fire is not real and has a purple tone to it. While not a real fire, being burned by it will feel real enough to kill those without the mental discipline required to resist the imaginary fire. As the fire is not real, there will not be any lingering heat left afterwards, but the illusion is so intense that there will be a small cloud of shimmering colours left instead.
