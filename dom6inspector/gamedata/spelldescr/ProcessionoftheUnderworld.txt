The caster leads a Lampade procession astray from its travels through the Underworld. Lampades, the nymphs of the Underworld, are joyful beings with a twisted sense of humor, that delight in dancing, revelry and hauntings and they willingly serve their new master, should opportunities of merriment present themselves. Lampades can guide the living and dead through the Underworld if their master can open a Stygian Gate.
