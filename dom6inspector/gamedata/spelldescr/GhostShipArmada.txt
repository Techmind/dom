This spell will awaken the dead Admiral Torgrin and make him fight for your cause. The Admiral will attack random coastal provinces controlled by your enemies and plunder it. The gold will be returned to the caster of the enchantment and the dead will be used to build up the armada. Once enough people have been killed the Admiral will create a new ghost armada. If the main armada with Admiral Torgrin is defeated no new armadas will be created. Once all armadas are defeated the enchantment will dissipate.
