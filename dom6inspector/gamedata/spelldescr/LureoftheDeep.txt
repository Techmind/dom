Sirens will start to emerge from the deeps when this powerful enchantment is cast. The Sirens will sing to enemy troops and lure them down to certain death in the deeps. The lure is most persuasive in coastal and sea provinces with strong friendly Dominion. Inland provinces are not affected at all. Nations that can recruit Sirens will find that this is cheaper while this enchantment is in effect. This global enchantment can only be cast in an underwater laboratory.
