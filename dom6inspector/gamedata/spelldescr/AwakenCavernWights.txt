An Oracle or Ktonian Necromancer summons the souls of several Pale Ones and makes them repossess their mummified bodies. Since the Breaking of the Seal the veil between the underworld and the world of the living seems to be shredded and torn, and the previously calm spirits of the Pale ones are now restless. It is no longer difficult to summon and bind numerous souls of the Pale Ones.
