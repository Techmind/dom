This ritual starts with a month of scribing complex magic symbols and eventually culminates with the sacrifice of five young girls. When the ritual is finished, a Disease Demon is bound and ordered to attack an enemy commander wherever in the world the caster chooses. The demon is very deadly and should be a sure way to kill an enemy.
