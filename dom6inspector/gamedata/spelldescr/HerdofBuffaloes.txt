This ritual summons a herd of buffaloes and makes them loyal to the caster. Buffaloes are strong and fierce and can be quite aggressive when they perceive a threat to their herd. Buffaloes are held in high esteem in the ancient lands of Ur, but there are other cultures that also revere their great strength.
