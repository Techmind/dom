The caster calls upon the supernatural forces of Fire itself and summons Anthrax, the King of Banefires. Anthrax was once one of the Kings of Elemental Fire and known as Catharsis. He has since fallen, earning himself a new name and title in the process. The King is a master of Fire and Death magic and is surrounded by a sickly green blaze of banefire.
