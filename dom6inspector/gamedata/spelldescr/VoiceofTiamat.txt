The caster conjures up the dreams of Tiamat, the Raging Sea. She has knowledge of all that lies underneath the sea. The voice of her dreams, when rightly interpreted, reveals all sites of Elemental power in a sea. The dreams will find their way to everyone living in that province and the magical sites will no longer be secret. This spell can only be cast under water.
