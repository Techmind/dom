The caster unleashes the Wild Hunt upon the world. The Hunt is led by Herne the Lord of the Hunt, an ancient deity of the wild roaming the woodlands in search of those who have offended the wild and its inhabitants. When the Hunt has been called, powerful priests of enemy faiths will be hunted down for as long as the Lord is not slain. Apart from the main hunt led by Herne the Lord of the Hunt, there are also up to four lesser hunts that helps him hunt down less important enemy sacred commanders. Sneaking commander might fool the lesser hunts, but Herne is extremely skilled and will find anyone eventually.
