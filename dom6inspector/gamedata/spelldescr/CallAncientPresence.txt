In the deepest parts of the most fearsome swamps there is something that devours everything that dares to enter. This is known as the ancient presence. It is very old and grows larger by incorporating the victims that it devours whole. No hero can stand against the ancient presence, it devours and incorporates anyone that gets close and only gets stronger by it. The ritual to call an ancient presence can only be performed in large swamp.
