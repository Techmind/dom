This spell summons a Monster Fish. This huge fish lives only in the deepest gorges of the ocean. When it is hunting, it will light up its antenna to lure prey closer. When the prey comes close, it will open its enormous mouth and swallow the prey whole. This works best against prey that is smaller than the Monster Fish, but it also has some sharp teeth to use against the really large opponents that can be found in the oceans.
