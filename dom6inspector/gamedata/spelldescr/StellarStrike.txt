By reading the stars carefully the astral mage will be able to foresee the perfect opportunity to inflict maximum damage on the enemy. When it is time a large swarm of meteors will be coaxed to fall down from the sky just as they pass above an enemy army camp in a faraway province. The astral mage will be able to observe the event as the meteors hit.
