Vegetation will grow into a dome that covers the entire province where the spell is cast. The dome will protect the province from many spells that originate outside the warded province. If left undisturbed, the forest dome will last forever. However, if a Fire spell is absorbed by the dome, it may catch fire and be destroyed. If the caster dies, the dome will wither and die.
