This enchantment transforms mining from something harsh and dangerous to a really uplifting experience. The miners can carve out gold and iron with their knives and the stone is extra soft where the valuable ore veins are as if the mountain is trying to guide them. The enchantment only works within friendly dominion and a higher dominion score will make it more effective. The enchantment gives a major boost to resource production and a minor boost to gold production, both increases depend on the resource value of the province. Also all magic sites that are income yielding mines will have their income up to doubled.
