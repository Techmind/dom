The mage-priest sits at a crossroads or in a graveyard for a week. After seven days, a Civateteo will appear. The mage persuades her to serve the Hungry God. Civateteo are noblewomen who died in childbirth and are called back to haunt the living. They are dressed in dark tattered robes and their faces and arms are covered with white chalk. They are shriveled and terrible to behold. They have priestly powers as well as skills in the dark arts.
