The caster curses the enemy army with the weight of earth and stones. Affected enemy units are severely burdened and moving will be slow and exhausting. Attack speed will not be affected, but fighting will be extra exhausting and can prove disastrous even for lightly armed soldiers. The curse will last until the battle is over.
