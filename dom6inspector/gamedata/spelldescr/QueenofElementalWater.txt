The caster calls the supernatural forces of the sea itself and summons one of the three Queens of Elemental Water. The Queens are masters of Water magic and difficult to damage when they are underwater. Unless they are completely killed in one combat round, they will heal all their wounds at the end of each round. Only one of the three Queens is able to leave the sea.
