The Warlocks of Abysia have experimented with crossbreeding since they first discovered blood magic. Under the influence of infernal magic Abysians, humans and giants are crossbred with demons, salamanders and other beasts. In the early days most of the experiments were conducted on Abysians, but the wars with Hinnom made the blood of giants occasionally available. In later times humans and humanbreds have dominated the breeding stock and abysian crossbreds are rarer. Due to the creation process many Hell Spawn suffer from various afflictions and early aging.
