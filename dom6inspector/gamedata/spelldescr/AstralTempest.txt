The caster unleashes an astral storm upon the battlefield. The storm is physically undetectable, but every unit that is not mindless takes damage as the storm rips the very souls from their bodies. Spellcasting is extra difficult during the astral tempest and all non mindless magic users will have trouble casting spells unless they have very high magic resistance.
