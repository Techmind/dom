The Blood mage sacrifices several blood slaves to contact and bind one of the four Heliophagii to serve him. Winged and powerful, the Heliophagii lead the armies of the Abyss. They are composed of darkness, but their claws and horns are golden and enchanted. Their ability to become invisible in shadows makes them truly horrible. Heliophagii are skilled in Blood magic. Once a Heliophagus dies, it returns to the Abyss and can be summoned once again.
