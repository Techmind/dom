With this spell, the mage hurls a maelstrom of flaming spheres towards an enemy province. The flame storm will strike an enemy army camp within the province with enormous force. Most likely, the majority of the units present will die from this powerful attack, but units resistant to fire or more sturdy than ordinary humans have a good chance of surviving. Through this ritual, the fire mage will also be able to see exactly what is happening as the flaming spheres strike the enemy.
