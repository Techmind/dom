The caster summons one of the four Balam. The Balam are powerful jaguar shaped spirits of fertility and servants of the Awakening Lord. There is one spirit for each cardinal direction. The Balam are able to change their shape at will. To the Zotz they often appear as Onaquis or Zotz sorcerers, but in battle they take their true form. The Balam are connected to the four cardinal directions and have corresponding powers.
