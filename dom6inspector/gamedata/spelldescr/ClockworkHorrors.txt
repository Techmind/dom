This spell recreates the work of the infamous watchmaker, Dr. Scheuer, who, in an attempt to increase the crop of prime Hoburg weed, designed a Hoburg-sized clockwork-driven automated harvester. Unfortunately, tragedy ensued when the harvesters used their piston-driven scythe arms not just on the crop but also on the hapless inhabitants of Hoburg. The inexplicable ferocity of the clockwork harvesters have since made them popular in more warlike circumstances.
