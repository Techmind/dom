By casting this spell, the mage can take command of a Sabbath and add the power of other mages who have cast Sabbath Slave. The fatigue that comes from casting spells will be distributed among all sabbath members and the communion master will also be able to cast more powerful spells than he could alone. While in a sabbath, all spells that only affect the caster will also affect all the sabbathslaves. A sabbath with two slaves will grant all masters one extra level in all their paths, four slaves will grant two levels, eight slaves will grant three levels, and so on.
