The caster casts a spell on a fortress in a nearby province and makes it disappear from everyone's memories. People are able to see and interact with the fortification, but once they leave they will forget about it. Scouts will forget to report about the palace and neighboring provinces will not know about it. Mages who scry upon the province will be able to see the fortification however. The spell is broken if the fortification is besieged. The ritual can also be used to hide the construction of the fortification.
