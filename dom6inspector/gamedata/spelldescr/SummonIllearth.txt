The caster summons an Earth Elemental to aid him in a battle. The earth elemental will be corrupted by the use of blood to summon it and the result is known as an illearth elemental. Illearth elementals are just as strong as real earth elementals and the blood gives them power to regenerate wounds even faster. Elementals shrink when they are hit by powerful strikes.
