The mage creates a Poison Golem, a metal giant made of dark alloys from the Underworld. The Poison Golem is made for a single purpose, destruction, and its mere presence is harmful to the living. The very land in which it stays will slowly wither and die. The construct is always surrounded by the sickly green flames of the Underworld.
