The caster makes vermin like rats and cockroaches (or shrimps and crabs) attracted to the supply stores of a besieged castle. The vermin will make sure that the supplies do not last very long. The more gems spent in this ritual the longer it will last. Having more than one Vermin Feast ritual active on the same province will not add to the effect and the ritual has no effect on an unbesieged castle.
