Vidyadharas are divine sages that left this world ages ago. They are spiritual beings who can fly without wings. Vidyadharas are known for their wisdom and magical abilities. They are primarily skilled in astral magic, but have some skills in air magic as well. They serve the Celestial Gods, but are sometimes summoned to this world by the monkey people living on the sacred mountain where the worlds lie closer.
