With this horrible spell, the necromancer releases a wind thick with the stench of open graves. The ice-cold wind is silent as it rends the flesh of living beings. With an effect similar to leprosy, the flesh of those affected turns pale and cracks open, leaving bare bones. Only death will stop the process.
