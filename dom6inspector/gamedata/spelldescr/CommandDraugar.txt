Nidavangr has fought endless battles against the vanir and the jotuns. The Seithberenders of the Crow Clan have discovered that the burial mounds of their enemies hold dark magics to protect them from intruders. With this ritual the Seithberender disturbs the burial mound and binds the Draugar dwelling within to his will. Draugar are corporeal undead vanir. They are incredibly strong and can change their size at will or if they are wounded. Draugar stink of decay and rotting flesh and are surrounded by ice cold winds.
