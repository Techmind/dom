The caster summons a group of Valkyries to aid him in battle. Valkyries are female Vanir and have the ability to fool humans with illusions. The Valkyries were granted the ability to fly in ancient times by a dead god who used them as messengers of death. The Valkyries still possess the power of flight. They come armed and ready for battle when summoned.
