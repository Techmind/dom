A Grand Lemur is the spirit of an ancient Scelerian Grand Thaumaturg that has been brought back from the Underworld. The thaumaturgs were the leading mage priests of the empire and the architects of the scelerian death cult. The souls of these powerful Lemures have broken the cycle of death and rebirth and will return from the Land of the Dead if slain in battle.
