The Sahir summons a Si'lat and binds it to his service. The Si'lat is a malign Jiniri spirit with shapeshifting abilities. They might be mistaken for Ghulahs, but are closer to the true Jinn and share many of their abilities, such as glamour, although they are not invisible. They are more closely attuned to storms and winds than the pure-blooded jinn born from Smokeless Flame. Si'lat likes to seduce and ensnare men with their powers, but unlike the Ghulahs they do not feed on the flesh of their victims. Just like a Ghulah their shapeshifting is limited and they always retain some animal part, which they try to hide underneath lavish gowns and dresses.
