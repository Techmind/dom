The caster opens his mind to allow other mages to guide his magic power. Mages who want to take advantage of the communion must cast the spell Communion Master (or carry an appropriate magic item). Being a communion slave can be dangerous if there are multiple communion masters or if the master is more skilled than the slave. The communion master can continue to drain energy from the communion slaves even if they become unconscious. This can be fatal.
