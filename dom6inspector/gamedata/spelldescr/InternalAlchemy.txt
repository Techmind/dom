The mystics and hermits of T'ien Ch'i have always been obsessed with longevity. Internal Alchemy is a method to transmute the inner self instead of external substances. Meditation, severe asceticism and breathing techniques are used to access the inner cinnabar fields in an attempt to alter them. Often the alchemist feeds on cinnabar, transmuted quicksilver, the most highly regarded alchemical substance, during the process. The transformative nature of the cinnabar might also transmute the mind of the hermit.
