This spell creates illusionary images of the caster. A skilled Glamour mage will get more images than a less skilled one. The images will surround the mage and make it harder for enemies to figure out which one to strike.  A strike will have an equal chance of hitting each image and the mage. If an image is hit it will disappear and further attacks are more likely to hit the caster. Unlike some other glamour effects, mirror images are not negated by true sight.
