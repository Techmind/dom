The necromancer revives the spectre of an Ermorian lady. The Wailing Lady weeps in lamentation over the annihilation of the Empire. The apparition is horrible to behold and her sorrow impossible to bear. Living beings drop dead upon hearing the wail of the spectral Lady. The Wailing Ladies are ethereal and difficult to damage with non-magical weapons. They are sacred and can be blessed by the priests of Ermor. Wailing Ladies can enter the sea.
