The Heliodromus performs a ritual slaying of a sacred bull. The Heliodromus takes his place in a trench underneath a plate of copper pierced with holes. The sacred bull is slain by the participants and its blood pour down upon the Heliodromus. Baptized in blood the Heliodromus is purified and endowed with the power of the Solar Bull. For one year the reborn Heliodromus is worshiped by his fellows as an incarnate God. The Heliodromus receives increased magical understanding and false prophet status. There can only be one elevated Heliodromus.
