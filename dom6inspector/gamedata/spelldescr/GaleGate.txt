The caster opens a rift in space creating a gate into a realm of storms. Huge amounts of aerial magic are effectively channeled through this gate, producing twenty Air gems each turn. Also air elementals summoned anywhere in the world will be extra powerful while the gale gate is open. Not all of the powers of the Gale Gate can be harnessed though. Hurricanes and storms will be randomly unleashed and hit a province somewhere in the world. The caster will be able to direct hurricanes and have them strike provinces that are controlled by the enemies. A high skill in air magic makes it more likely to successfully steer the hurricanes away.
