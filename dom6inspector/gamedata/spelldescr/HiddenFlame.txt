The caster unleashes the Hidden Flame upon the enemies of this world. Initially created by the Arch Wizards of the Hidden Flame to combat the Horrors of the Void, it is equally effective against other otherworldly and magical beings. The Hidden Flame burns with an intense blueish flame that consumes magic essence and destroys magical beings. Anyone standing close to the Flame will risk getting soul burns.
