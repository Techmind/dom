The caster unleashes the Erinyes upon the world.  The Erinyes are three horrible spirits of vengeance that punish those who slay innocent women. In elder times, they upheld the ban against Blood magic, but they have since returned to the darkness whence they came.  They are sometimes called the Eumenides, the Kindly Ones, but their true names are Avenger of Murder, Grudging Anger and The Unrelenting One.  Sinners will hear the horrible baying of the sisters and madness will strike them unless they are found and most gruesomely slain by the sisters.  The first sister kills those who have killed, the second one hunts those who use blood magic and the third one hunts the enemies of he who summoned her and her sisters.  The Kindly Ones remain in the world until the enchantment is dispelled or the three of them are slain.
