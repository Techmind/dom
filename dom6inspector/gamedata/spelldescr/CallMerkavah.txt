With a tremendous sacrifice of power the caster calls down the ultimate manifestation of heavenly power. A Merkavah, a heavenly chariot of vast and unbearable power forms in the skies. In a blaze of otherworldly splendor, four wheels covered by four wings move the Merkavah in four directions. Above the four wheels at the center of the solar glory is a living being with four faces, four wings, four colors and four lives. Above the living being is a sapphire dome of stellar might beyond which the unbearable might of the Celestial Thrones is visible. After the vision of the heavens subsides, the four wheels and the Tetramorph remain to command the faithful and destroy the servants of sin.
