The Blood mage sacrifices several blood slaves to contact and bind one of the six Ice Devils. Each Ice Devil is the ruler of one of the six icy realms of Kokytos, the cold lands of the Inferno. Their large bodies are composed of ice and they are constantly surrounded by a wind of infernal cold. Ice Devils are powerful mages of Water, but it is their physical might that sets them apart as generals of the Infernal wars.
