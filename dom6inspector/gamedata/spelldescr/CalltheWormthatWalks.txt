Potent nature mages do not die easily, and for the more potent even death might not stop them. When the worms and bugs that feed of carrion devour the corpse of a dead nature mage, some of them manage to transfer a portion of their mind and power into the crawling mass feeding on their remnants. This spell summons the remnant lifeforce of such a mage and the worms and bugs that houses it.
