A huge blazing pyre lights up the landscape. It never burns out and the embers of the pyre will absorb the heat and can be harvested as magical gems imbued with the fiery power of the pyre. The Eternal Pyre causes the temperature to rise to unbearable levels in the province where it is cast. Once the eternal pyre has started burning, it will be impossible to extingish without the use of magic. Even putting it underwater would only reduce its heat a little.
