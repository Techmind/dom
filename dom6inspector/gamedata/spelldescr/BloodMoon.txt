By making an enormous blood sacrifice when both the stars and the moon are right, it is possible to imbue the moon with the power of the blood. The moon will turn red as blood and as long as it is visible in the night sky, performing blood magic during the night will be much easier. The moon turning red is a powerful sign of misfortune and that will be felt in the entire world. All blood mages will start to perform their rituals under the moon at night and have their power increased for rituals and blood hunting. The moon will not have any effect in caves, underwater or if there is no night, e.g. in the presence of two suns.
