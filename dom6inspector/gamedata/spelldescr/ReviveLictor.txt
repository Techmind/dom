The necromancer revives an Ermorian Lictor. The Lictors were dignitaries entrusted with keeping the order during the Empire's glory days. Lictors are corporeal undead of great physical strength. They are armored with rusty plate hauberks and wield great axes formerly used as a sign of their office. Lictors are so closely connected with the Netherworld that they are surrounded by a wind of numbing cold. If revived by a necromancer wearing a Black Laurel, three additional Lictors will reawaken from the dead.
