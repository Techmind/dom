The caster transforms seven ordinary boars into beings of flesh and steel. People do not like to be permanently transformed and would probably revolt against masters that tried to curse them with iron bodies. Pigs, on the other hand, are not bothered, or at least they don't complain. Pigs are also preferred to dogs, as they have the size and strength to trample human-sized opponents. The transformation does not make the pigs braver.
