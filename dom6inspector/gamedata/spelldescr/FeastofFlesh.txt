For this ritual, the Blood mage requires a huge banquet of food, drink and young girls. Praghasas are fat demon ogres of huge appetites and after they have eaten all the girls they are bound to serve the Blood mage forever. These demons are known as the gluttons and in combat they rely mostly on their great strength.
