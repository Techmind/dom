The Draug is a corporeal undead van. They are incredibly strong and can change their size at will or if they are wounded. Draugar stink of decay and rotting flesh and are surrounded by ice cold winds. With this ritual a few Draugar are coerced to leave their mounds and kill the enemies of the realm.
