The necromancer enchants ten well-prepared corpses and gives them false life. The skeletons are then equipped with magic bows fueled by the power of the Underworld. Arrows fired from these bows will burst into the green flames of banefire. Flesh exposed to banefire will start to fester and decay. Skeletons are undead and will fall apart if left on the battlefield without undead leadership.
