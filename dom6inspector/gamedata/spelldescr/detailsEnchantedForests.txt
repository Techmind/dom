All forests (including cave forests) under neutral or enemy dominion spread dominion as if they were temples of the caster's pretender.
Forests with friendly dominion will spontaneously spawn attacks in the province or enemy controlled neighboring provinces. A strong dominion and high Growth scale helps the effectiveness of the attacks. Wastelands are never attacked.
