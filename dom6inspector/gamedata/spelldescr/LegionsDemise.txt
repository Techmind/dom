When this enchantment is active the enemies will experience relentless attacks on themselves and all their allies. Arrows will come hailing down, twisted hands will emerge from the ground and scratch them, swords will appear out of thin air and strike at them. The damage is not real, but with the help of glamour magic it will be deadly as soon as it has become severe enough.
