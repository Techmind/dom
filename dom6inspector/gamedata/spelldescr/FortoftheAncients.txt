In ancient times, Pangaea made its forts not from mud and mortar but bramble and birch. This ritual forces nature to form a complete fortress in a matter of weeks, sturdy enough to rival stone walls. The ritual can only be cast in forests or shallow seas, where an appropriate amount of vegetation can be found.
