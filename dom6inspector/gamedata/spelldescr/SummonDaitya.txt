Daityas are handsome demon-titans of ancient times. Together with the Danavas they led the Rakshasas in a great war against the Devatas and Gandharvas of Kailasa. The demon armies were defeated and the Daityas and Davanas were banished to the Nether Realms where they made themselves lords and kings. With this ritual they can be summoned to serve a new God on its path to ascendancy.
