The caster enscribes and enchants a great stone archway, creating an arcane portal to Nexus, a place between places. Armies may hereafter use the portal to enter Nexus. Nexus is connected to all active Nexus Gates and individuals and armies in Nexus may leave through any gate, even those created by other Pretenders. The Nexus Gate is permanent and once created it cannot be dispelled. Dwelling in Nexus for longer than necessary is not recommended, as it is located in the Void where horrors thrive.
