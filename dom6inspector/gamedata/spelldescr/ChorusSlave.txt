The witches and bards of Man have developed the spell singing techniques of the Tuatha further. Through communal chanting they are able to strengthen the arcane harmonies of their spell songs. Chorus slaves only follow the chant of the Chorus Masters and are inactive during the battle. If a chorus slave loses consciousness they leave the communal chant. Only spell singers can cast this spell.
