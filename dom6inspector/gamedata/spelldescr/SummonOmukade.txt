The caster summons an Omukade, a monstrous centipede that lives in the lands of the Bakemono. Its scales are as hard as iron and its poison is strong enough to kill any beast. The Omukade is strong enough to be feared even by the Tatsu. There are even reports of Omukade driving dragons from their homes and settling in the cave.
