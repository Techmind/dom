This enchantment enables the mage to see all provinces in the world. Dominions can be seen in great detail and so can discovered magic sites, but income cannot be determined exactly. Inside the God's own Dominion income as well as any troop movements and battles can be seen in great detail. This includes the detection of any glamoured or invisible troops that are not stealthing. Patrolling units inside friendly dominion will find it much easier to detect enemy scouts and to quell unrest. The historic records for all nations can be accessed and everyone on the Hall of Fame can be inspected.
