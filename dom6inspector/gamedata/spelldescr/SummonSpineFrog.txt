The caster summons a Spine Frog and binds it to his service. The Spine Frog is a large amphibian beast found in warm swamps and marshlands. Their skin is highly poisonous and they can spit poison when they feel threatened. When hunting they grab their prey with their tongue and often swallow it whole.
