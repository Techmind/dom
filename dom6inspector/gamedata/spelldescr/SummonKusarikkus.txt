The caster summons a pair of Kusarikku, fabled Bull Men of enkidu legends. They have been revered by the enkidus since before the founding of the First City and are known to protect the Ensis and Entus, as well as the entrances to the great temple. The Kusarikku are gifted with the strength of the earth and they wield spears that halt demons in their steps.
