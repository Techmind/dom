With this ritual a nature mage will try to poison an entire enemy army camp by releasing the poisonous gases that are trapped under the ground. This ritual will only work against armies that are located in swamps or drip caves as only these terrains have these gases trapped beneath them. The nature mage will be able to view the release of the gases through the ritual and observe the effects on the enemy army.
