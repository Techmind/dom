A massive storm of fire is unleashed on the battlefield. Everyone on the battlefield will be burned to cinders within minutes. The storm lasts for the duration of the battle or until the fire mage dies. The fire storm will also shroud the entire battlefield in brightness, reducing the effect of night and certain spells.
