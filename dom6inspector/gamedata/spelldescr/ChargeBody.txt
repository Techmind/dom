When a charged body is struck in melee combat, a powerful jolt of electricity will strike the attacker. However the mage will also receive some shock damage from the discharge, but it will be much less severe. The damage caused by the electrical charge bypasses the protection of armor and is very deadly. Once hit, the mage's body will become discharged and, if the mage survives, will need to be recharged.
