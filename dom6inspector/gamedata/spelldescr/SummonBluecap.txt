The caster summons a Cave Kobold from the Dreamwild and prevents the magic of the dreamwild to leave its body. The true shape of a Bluecap that hasn't lived in this world for too long is a dancing blue flame, but it often takes the shape of a Cave Kobold with a bright blue cap. Normally Bluecaps lose some of their connection with the Dreamwild over time, and with it its magic abilities, turning into a regular Cave Kobold. Bluecaps are skilled in earth and glamour magic.
