Everything left by the Ancient Ones has become subject to worship by the humans of Agartha. Statues left in halls underneath the earth are adored and worshiped, enchanted and given magical life by the Golem Crafters. The great statues of ancient Seal Guards are the foremost of these living statues: sacred guardians ever watching and waiting. This spell will make one of these statues come to life.
