The necromancer revives the spectre of an ancient Ermorian mage. The mages of Ermor were the ones who performed the rituals that corrupted and destroyed the old empire. The mages do not possess solid bodies, but their spirits are connected to the Netherworld and their powers of Death magic are greater than ever before. The touch of these mages will drain the life energy of the target and replenish the power of the mage. They are ethereal and are very difficult to harm without using magic weapons.
