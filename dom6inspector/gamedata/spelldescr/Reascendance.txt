By sacrificing enough blood, the caster shatters the infernal prison of a Fallen Angel, allowing it to reascend to the Earthly Spheres. The Fallen Angel will gladly serve its liberator and will use all its powers to further his goals. The Angel was a powerful user of Fire magic before its fall from grace. Now it has learned to use Blood magic as well.
