The caster erects two gates into the Dreamwild. Through the first comes fulfillment and true dreams that tell of the future, from the other comes dreams of deception or despair. Rituals cast at the Gates of Horn and Ivory will have their reach extended greatly. Also a huge amount of Glamour gems can be harvested from the gates each month.
