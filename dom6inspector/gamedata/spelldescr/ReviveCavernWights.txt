Since the planning of the War under the Sun some Oracles of the Dead have begun experimenting with summoning of the dead. With this ritual an Oracle of the dead summons the souls of a few Pale Ones and makes them repossess their mummified bodies. The corpses of Pale Ones are entombed and well cared for and their souls are generally calm. Reviving them is remarkably difficult and time consuming. So far no one has tried to awaken the soul of an ancient Pale One.
