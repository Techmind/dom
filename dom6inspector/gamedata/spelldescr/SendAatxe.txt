The Aatxe is a flaming bull spirit and servant of the Mother of Storms. It emerges from its cave abode during storms and bad weather to punish those who have angered their mistress. In ancient times the Sorginak were granted the means to call the Aatxe and send it against those who have wronged them or their mistress.
