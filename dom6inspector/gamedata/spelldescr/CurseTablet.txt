With the emergent interest in the fate of souls in Arcoscephale, necromantic practices have emerged. While most Orphic Mystics try to find the mysteries of a blessed afterlife, some less scrupulous individuals have used the new insights to command the newly dead. With this ritual the necromancer approaches the grave of a newly dead and places a tablet on it. The soul of the dead one is prevented from transmigrating or finding rest until it has performed the curse on the tablet. The spirit will travel to a distant province and curse a commander before finding final rest.
