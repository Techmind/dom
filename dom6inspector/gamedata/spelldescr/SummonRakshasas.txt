Rakshasas are black-skinned demon ogres of the wild forests. They feast on the flesh of monkeys and men and are greatly feared. Rakshasas have ravenous appetites and are best kept well fed. Most Rakshasas are found in the demon kingdom of Lanka, but some are summoned by unscrupulous monkey sorcerers.
