The caster summons a Water Elemental to aid him in battle. Water Elementals are quick and crush enemies regardless of armor. Elementals shrink when they are hit by powerful strikes. Water Elementals summoned in cold climates will be composed of ice. Ice Elementals are stronger but slower than Water Elementals.
