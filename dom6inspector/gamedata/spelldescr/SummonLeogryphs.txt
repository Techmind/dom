With this ritual a convocation of Leogryphs is summoned and controlled. The Leogryph is a mythical halfbeast, part lion, part eagle. It is by some scholars considered to be a degenerate form of the gryphon. They are only slightly stronger than lions, but their mythical heritage makes them more resistant to magic effects.
