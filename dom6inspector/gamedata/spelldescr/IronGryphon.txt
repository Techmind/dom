The mage casts an iron statue in the form of a gryphon and infuses it with fiery magic. It can unleash cones of flames upon enemies in its vicinity. The Iron Gryphon is immobile and often placed in a defensible position in a fort or army camp where it can impress onlookers as well as blast would be attackers with fire.
