The caster creates an enormous whirlwind that originates in the province where the ritual is performed.  With the help of astral magic the whirlwind will be sucked dry of any magical energies and then when it sweeps out over the world it will absorb elemental magic to replenish itself.  The absorbed magic is then distilled into pure air gems at the origin.  All elemental gem producing sites within range will have their output severely reduced as their magic is absorbed by the wind instead.  Air being light is most affected, leaving nothing left and earth being heavy is least affected.  Sites and rituals that extend the range of air rituals from a province will help the winds reach further.
