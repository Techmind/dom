The Marids are rebellious Jinnun of vast powers. Banished from the City of Brass by the Ifrit Sultans they fled into the depths of the ocean. When mankind overtook the world and magic was lost, Ubar could no longer keep rebellious Marids at bay and they returned to the world. Marids are attracted to magic and can be lured and bound with powerful sorcery. They are powerful Jinn born from smokeless flame, but their maritime exile has granted them powers over water as well as the powers of fire, air and earth.
