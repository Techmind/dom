The caster creates a replica of himself and enchants it with glamour magic to give it false life. The simulacrum will be controlled by the original owner's soul and the simulacrum also inherits all the magic powers of its creator. In turn the creator's body is placed in a state of deep torpor that only ends when the simulacrum dies. However, there is a chance that the caster's soul will fail to return and become trapped and lost in the dreamwild, possibly until his soul withers away and dies.
