This spell gives all friendly units a second chance to live. An affected unit that dies will rise again as a mindless soulless being and continue to fight. Undead and inanimate beings are not affected by this spell. Affected commanders will remain commanders, but they will likely suffer from severe mental afflictions from becoming a soulless.
