The caster sacrifices several blood slaves to contact and bind a Devil. Devils are infernal beings of great strength. They are born in the fires of the Inferno and are impervious to heat and flame. Their glowing bodies radiate heat and bat-like wings grow from their shoulders. Devils are armed with a trident and their barbed tails can sting opponents in close combat.
