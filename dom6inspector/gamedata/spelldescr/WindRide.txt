The Air mage summons a whirlwind in a province of his choice. The whirlwind will try to find a commander in the province and transport him to where the Air mage is located. This spell is an effective way to rescue cornered commanders, but it can also be a very effective way to get enemy commanders out of the way. Large beings are difficult or impossible to lift and might fall to the ground somewhere along the way, possibly dying upon impact. Powerful Earth mages are likewise difficult to transport.
