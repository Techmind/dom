The caster sows a handful of dragon teeth and enchants them with powerful spells. Soon Spartoi, sown men, will emerge from the ground fully armed and ready for battle. The sown men are skeletal in appearance, but are not truly undead. They are armed in gleaming armaments and wield magical spears. The Spartoi will dissolve if left without magical leadership or when the battle is over.
