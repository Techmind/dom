Two Will o' the Wisps are summoned to help their summoner in battle. They appear at the edges of the battlefield. A Will o' the Wisp is a glowing sphere, looking like a light from a bright lantern. In combat, it glows with great intensity, burning anyone nearby. It is very difficult to hit a Will o' the Wisp in combat due to its great speed and small size.
