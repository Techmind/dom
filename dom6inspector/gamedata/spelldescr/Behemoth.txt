With this enchantment, the necromancer has mastered a dark ritual enabling him to reanimate the largest of all animals. The former elephant is preserved in a state of perpetual decay by a revenant mage who rides the Behemoth, constantly fueling it with energies from the Underworld. The most important part of the reanimation ritual is the binding of the revenant mage's spirit to the Behemoth. This direct spiritual control of the Behemoth gives it high magic resistance. As all of the revenant mage's energies are used in controlling and preserving the beast, he or she is unable to cast spells.
