This mighty enchantment absorbs magical energies worldwide to replenish the caster's magical resources. Half of all magic gems used to cast spells and to create magic items will be absorbed into the Arcane Nexus and converted into astral pearls at a two to one ratio. The purity of Astral and Blood magic makes it impossible for the Nexus to absorb any magic when these types of spells are cast, but all other types of magic will have some of their power absorbed by the Nexus. Even when no spells are cast or no items are forged, the Nexus will absorb some ambient magic energy from the world.
