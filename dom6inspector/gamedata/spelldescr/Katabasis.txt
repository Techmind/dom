A mystic of the Sacred River of Death and Rebirth descends into the underworld through the Sacred River and prepares a path for an eventual return from the underworld. If the Renatus or Renata is slain, he or she returns from the underworld to the province where the ritual was cast. They will be soaked in stygian waters and possibly gaining dark insights in the process. For the ritual to work, the province it was cast in must be in friendly hands when the mystic dies.
