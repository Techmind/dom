A Lemur Consul is the spirit of an ancient Scelerian Consul that has been brought back from the Underworld. Able commanders and powerful priests, the Consuls were influential Senators chosen to command the legions of Sceleria. The souls of these powerful Lemures have broken the cycle of death and rebirth and will return from the Land of the Dead if slain in battle.
