The caster summons a Faery Queen and her court from the Dreamwild. Faery Queens are mighty fay beings that sometimes emerge in deep woodland realms where they form courts of fay beings mimicking their human counterparts. Calling themselves Queens they take the appearance of beautiful butterfly-winged females dressed in unimaginable splendour. Faery Queens are skilled mages of the Dreamwild and are adept at Glamour and Nature magic. They also have limited skills in air, water or earth magic. If cast in a frozen forest an unseelie queen and her court will answer the call instead.
