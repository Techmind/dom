This spell recreates the legendary enchantment of Asg√•rd. The fortress is surrounded by a ring wall of enchanted flames. The flames are able to read the intentions of those who approach and will let friends pass safely through. Flying beings that pass over the flames will still be put on fire, but the damage will be less severe than for those walking through.
