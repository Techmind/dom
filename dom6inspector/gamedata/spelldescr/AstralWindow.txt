The caster opens an arcane rift through which he can observe distant lands. The rift closes after a while, but the duration can be prolonged if extra magic gems are used in the casting. Each casting of this ritual allows the mage to scry on one province. The information gained by this spell is much more accurate than a normal scout can provide.
