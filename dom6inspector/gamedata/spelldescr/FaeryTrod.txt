The mage leads his army into a magic forest to find a Faery Trod. The army follows this strange path through faerie lands and will finally arrive in a distant forest. Both the source and destination provinces must be forests for this spell to work. Navigating on the faerie paths is a tricky adventure and it might be that you won't emerge exactly where you planned.
