The caster summons a Gnome to serve him. The Gnome is a small fay creature of the Dreamwild. They usually live in forests or vales far from civilization, where they tend the flora and fauna of the region. All Gnomes are skilled in the magic of the land as well as in glamour magic which they use to hide themselves from pesky humans. They appear as small, gnarled old men with bright, red caps. Gnomes are fay creatures and are vulnerable to iron.
