The Juggernaut is a colossal structure made out of religious idols and two pairs of enormous wheels. The machine is powered by Astral magic and will require magic leadership in order to make it move. A construction like this has to be almost as holy as the God itself and, rightfully, it does spread the Dominion of its God just like a Prophet. To make it complete, the Juggernaut is covered by a layer of gold to make it look even more religiously important.
