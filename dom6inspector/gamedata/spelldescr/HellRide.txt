The caster summons a swarm of imps and commands them to carry him to a distant province with haste. Although supernaturally fast the imps are not very strong and can't lift anything heavier than a human. While the imps are faster than normal fliers they cannot teleport and can have the path blocked by impassable mountains, cave walls or the Sea of Ice global enchantment.
