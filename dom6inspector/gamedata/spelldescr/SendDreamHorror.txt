The caster sends a Defiler of Dreams to attack a distant province. The Dream Horror will project nightmares and feed on the emotional distress of its victims. Unrest will increase in the province until the Horror is found and slain. Dealing with horrors is not without risk however and the caster of this ritual might attract some unwanted attention.
