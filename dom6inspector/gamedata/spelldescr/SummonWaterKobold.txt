The caster summons a water Kobold. Kobolds are small fay creatures from the Dreamwild who occasionally appear on the fringes of civilized lands. Water Kobolds live on ships and are generally merry and friendly. Water Kobolds aren't very good leaders, but they can bring soldiers with them across the sea. They appear as small and weathered fishermen in yellow clothes and are usually puffing on a tobacco pipe.
