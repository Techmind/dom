This ritual opens up a way for the hot infernal gases trapped under the depths, to make their way into the sea. The blood and earth mage casting the ritual will guide the fumes to just where the enemy forces are camping. The gases are blisteringly hot and deadly poisonous to most living beings. The mage will also get a vision of the effect taking place.
