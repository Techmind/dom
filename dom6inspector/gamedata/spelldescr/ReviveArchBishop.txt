The necromancer revives an ancient and unholy priest. The Priests of Eldregate were responsible for performing the ceremonies in the Holy City of Eldregate. When the Dusk Elders succumbed to the dark lure of Death magic, the Priests of Eldregate sat silent and watched the Empire fall. As a result, they were cursed more strongly than the rest of the population and are the ones who perform the unholy rites of reanimation. The Priests of Eldregate are surrounded by a wind of numbing cold.
