The caster contacts an Iron Angel to teach the weak to be strong. The Angel is a divine being professing the might of skill and craftsmanship. It teaches men not to trust in sorcery or religion. Only faith in yourself and the weapon you wield will grant you true strength. The Iron Angel is not sacred and will readily hunt down and slay fanatical adherents of other faiths.
