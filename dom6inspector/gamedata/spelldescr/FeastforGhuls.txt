Sorcerers skilled in blood magic can invite demonic beings of the desert to join him in a grisly feast. A number of Ghuls are summoned and bound to servitude. Ghuls are monstrous beings related to the Jinnun of the deserts. They haunt graveyards and remote deserts where they waylay travelers and feed upon their flesh. Ghuls are spiritual beings with hyena heads and ass's hooves. They are able to change their shape and take physical form, although they can never change their hooves. Ghuls are almost unkillable, and only if you strike it down in one blow will it die permanently. If it is not killed outright it will revert to its spiritual hyena-headed form. Ghuls are demonic in nature and can be banished by servants of the Divine.
