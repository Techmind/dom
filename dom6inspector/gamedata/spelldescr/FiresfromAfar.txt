The mage fires a row of flame bolts towards an enemy army camp located in a province far away. The more units present in the camp, the greater the chance of hitting a target. The spell can also be used to harass a besieging force or the defenders of a castle. A scout or a scrying spell will be required to see whether the spell was successful or not.
