The Panic Apostate gives unholy life and powers to the carcass of a rotting Dryad. The Carrion Lady still has some skills in the use of Nature magic, but her priestly powers are corrupted. She has unholy powers over the dead and is able to create Manikins by animating vines, roots and the bones of dead beasts.
