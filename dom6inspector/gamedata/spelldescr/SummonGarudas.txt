Garudas are divine bird-warriors that left this world ages ago. They are eternal enemies of Nagas and serpent-kin and are highly resistant to poison. They serve the Celestial Gods, but are sometimes summoned to this world by the monkey people living on the sacred mountain where the worlds lie closer. Garudas are blessed with an Aura of Splendor that strikes mortals with awe.
