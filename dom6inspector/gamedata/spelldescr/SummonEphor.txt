The Ephoroi were once magistrates and leaders of the human population of Therodos. They presided over religious ceremonies where the Meliai were not present. The ghosts of these men can be summoned to serve as leaders of the ghostly realm of the drowned dead as they once did in life. The Ephoroi are able to call human spectres to fill the ranks of the ghostly armies.
