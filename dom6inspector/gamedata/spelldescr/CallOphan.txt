The caster calls down a manifestation of heavenly power from the Celestial Sphere. The Ophanim, wheels, are angelic beings of unfathomable and otherworldly might. They appear as a brilliance covered by four wings, that when unfolded reveal a wheel intersecting another wheel of gleaming brass. The rim of the wheel is covered by eyes of sparkling chrysolite and the being is surrounded by a blaze like that of the sun. The Ophanim see all that passes under their many eyes and watch the affairs of men from the heavenly spheres.
