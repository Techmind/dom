The caster projects a dart of Bane Fire against his enemies. The Bane Fire is a sickly greenish flame said to burn in the braziers of the Underworld. The green flame consumes the life force of those burnt by it, even after the flames themselves have subsided. Everyone close to the initial target of the spell may be affected by the decaying effects of the Bane Fire.
