The Camazotz of Xibalba practice a magic tradition that teaches that a person has four souls; blood, bone, breath and shadow. This spell damages the soul of blood, making the target bleed profusely from bodily orifices and possibly causing the soul of the blood to permanently die and the target to waste away and die over the next couple of months. Undead and inanimate beings have no blood and are not affected by the spell.
