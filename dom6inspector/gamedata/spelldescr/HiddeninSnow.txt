This spell can only be cast where there are high mountains nearby. The caster locates and releases a tribe of ancient undead warriors from their glacial prison. A full tribe of Unfrozen is freed. The Unfrozen are led by a chieftain and a mage. If cast in a province of turmoil a warlike tribe with greater amounts of warriors will answer the call. If cast in a province of fortune or magic, a tribe with more mages is likely to answer the call.
