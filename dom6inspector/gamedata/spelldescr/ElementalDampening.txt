This ritual dampens any attempt at manipulating the elemental powers. All combat spells of primarily the elemental paths will be much slower to cast. Any elemental beings summoned will be slightly weaker than usual. This dampening will also make it more difficult to perform elemental rituals and forging magic items that are mainly elemental in nature, additional gems are required when performing these activities.
