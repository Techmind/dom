The caster performs the rites necessary to communicate with and persuade a Lamia Queen to aid him. The Lamia Queen is an ancient Lamia sorceress of great power. She carries an oath rod that will destroy the minds of those it strikes. The Lamia Queen has an amazing regenerative ability and when killed, will transform into a black serpent and continue fighting. If she is killed a second time, however, she will remain dead.
