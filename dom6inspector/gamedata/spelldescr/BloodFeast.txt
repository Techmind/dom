The caster has learned the recuperative secrets of cannibalism. In a gruesome ritual lasting a month he consumes the blood and feast of ritually purified sacrifices. The blood feast requires copious amounts of flesh and blood of unpurified victims as well however, so the populace in the province where the caster resides is slaughtered in great quantities. The flesh and blood of the victims rejuvenates the caster, healing him of all or at least most afflictions. Bloodmages who partake too often in blood feasts often develop uncontrollable cravings for human flesh. The ritual does not work on inanimate beings.
