The caster makes a mechanical dragon covered with thick iron plates. The iron dragon is tremendously large, almost invulnerable and unaffected by heat, cold, shock and poison. They are able to fly and can trample smaller beings. In its iron belly a furnace of magic flames waits to be released upon its enemies. Should the dragon be destroyed the magical furnace will explode and kill everyone near the iron monstrosity. Iron Dragons are mindless, magical beings and will cease to function when left without magical leadership.
