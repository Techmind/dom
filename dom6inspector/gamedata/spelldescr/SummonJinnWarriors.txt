Jinnun are spiritual beings born from smokeless flame in a distant past. They replaced the Hinn and Binn during the reign of a previous Pantokrator. They are naturally invisible and ethereal, but can take physical form when they interact with men. Once the Jinnun lived in Ubar, a magic desert kingdom of marvelous riches. The City of Brass fielded armies of Jinnun, wielding magic and armed with enchanted weapons. These Jinn Warriors are sometimes called upon by the Jiniri Queens of Na'Ba. True-blooded Jinnun are sacred in the queendom of Na'Ba.
