This spell summons three Oni. Oni are small ugly demons with wild staring eyes, unkempt red hair and pot-bellies. They have clawed feet, fangs and porcine faces. Oni dress in tiger skins and wield huge swords and carry javelins. Oni don't need to eat. However, they have tremendous appetites and like to eat and their human servants are often left starving if food is scarce. Oni are almost immortal. If their body is slain, their spirit will survive. If the spirit is not slain or banished as well, it will reform a new body over time. Their residual spirit form is a ghost and can be banished.
