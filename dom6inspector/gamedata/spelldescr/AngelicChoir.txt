The caster contacts an angelic choir and asks for its aid. Three Angels of the Heavenly Choir answer the call. Angels are divine beings in human form. They are winged and dressed in white robes. Angels sing praises to the Lord and will automatically join an arcane chorus as chorus slaves. They are surrounded by a radiant aura that intimidates cowardly beings. Angels have partial resistance to lightning and fire.
