The Touch of the Desert will affect a small number of enemies with severe dehydration. The enemies must stand adjacent to the caster for the spell to take effect. The dehydrated targets will become more and more exhausted and may eventually lose consciousness. The duration of the dehydration depends on the magic resistance of the targets. Undead beings and constructs are not affected by this spell.
