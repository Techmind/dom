This spell will awaken all the bushes and small trees on the battlefield. The awakened trees and bushes will uproot themselves and start to fight for the nature mage that awakened them. Bushes are usually slow and not very well suited for fighting, but they are surprisingly strong and they may easily kill a human should they get hold of one.
