The caster summons two Lammashtas to the battle. A Lammashta is a horrific angelic being that serves the Lord of the Underworld. Ethereal and capable of flight, these female entities wield Wraith Swords, which drain the life from those wounded by their blades. They do not serve the caster but rather the Lord of the Underworld. They will appear at the edge of the battlefield and will probably not attack the caster at the start of the battle.
