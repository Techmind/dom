The alchemist creates a bath of water and vitriol. The vitriolic water is given form and purpose through powerful alchemical rituals. The alchemical entity is known as a Gelatinous Cube. It slowly slides forward and swallows anything it passes over. Swallowed beings quickly dissolve in the vitriol, unless the cube is destroyed and its magic unraveled.
