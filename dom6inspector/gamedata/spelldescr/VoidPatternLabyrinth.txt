A void pattern dome is created over the province that the mage is located in.  This pattern is invisible to human perception, but horrors will see the strange pattern and get confused and led astray when trying to pass.  The dome will protect the province from any horrors trying to attack from the outside, including against those drawn to horror marks.  The more magic gems put into the spell, the longer it will last.  If the mage dies, the void pattern labyrinth dissolves instantly.  The chance of warding off a Doom Horror is lower than for normal horrors.
