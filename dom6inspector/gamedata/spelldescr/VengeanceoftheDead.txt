The mage will contact the dead souls of all the people or creatures that the target has slain. These dead souls will then be guided to the dreams of the target, where they can attack him in a horrible nightmare. The mage will ensure that the target is pulled strongly into the nightmare, so that he stays dead if the dead souls are successful in killing him. This spell does not work on mindless or undead beings and the target must have slain units in combat for the spell to work. One province is chosen for the spell and the greatest butcher of all enemy commanders in that province will be targeted for the nightmare.
