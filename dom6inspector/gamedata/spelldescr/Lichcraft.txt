With knowledge of this ritual, the Death mage has discovered the means to remove his own viscera and place it in a jar, killing himself, only to return as an immortal undead being of great power. By dying and returning from the dead the Lich gains insights and powers in the path of death magic. Furthermore, the body of the Lich becomes almost impossible to harm with mundane weapons. Should the body of the Lich be physically destroyed, a new one is formed from the dust of the dead.
