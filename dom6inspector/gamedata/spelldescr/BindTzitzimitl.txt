Tzitzimitl are demons of the Stellar Spheres. Once they rebelled against the Celestial Divinities and were thrown down to the Terrestrial Sphere. Here, they found worshipers in the people of Mictlan. With the awakening of the Bloodthirsty Lord, the Star Demons became sacred messengers and servants. Tzitzimitl are glowing blue man-scorpions with crowns and girdles that radiate stellar light. They have feathered arms that let them fly. In battle, the Star Demons unleash bolts of stellar power that kill those with tender souls.
