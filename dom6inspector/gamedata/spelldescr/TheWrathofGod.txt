With this enchantment, lighting will strike the enemies of the God, no matter where they are. However, the lightning bolts strike most powerfully in provinces where the God has a strong Dominion. In provinces with a high turmoil scale more thunderbolts strike. Enemies under water or inside caves are not affected.
