One of the Greater Daevas of the Daevic Heptad is summoned. These are six demonic beings of vast power who serve the Lord of Destruction. Each Daeva represents an aspect of their Lord. There are Daevas of Evil Intentions, Frozen Minds, Oppression, Discontent, Destruction and Aging. All are powerful destructive beings with magic corresponding to their nature. Their mere presence will cause turmoil, unrest and maladies where they dwell.
