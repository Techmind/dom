The caster contacts a Marid and persuades it to abandon its rebellious ways and return to serve the awakening Lord. Marids are rebellious Jinnun of vast powers banished from the City of Brass by the Ifrit Sultans. Everywhere they went they caused strife and disorder so the Sultans hunted them until they fled into the ocean depths. They are powerful Jinn born from smokeless flame, but their maritime exile has granted them powers over water as well as the powers of fire, air and earth.
