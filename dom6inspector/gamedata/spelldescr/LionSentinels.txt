The caster sculpts eleven statues of lions and enchants them with powerful magic. Ten of them are placed outside the castle walls and the eleventh on the courtyard. Order and prosperity flowers as the lions sentinels protect the inhabitants and guard them from harm. Should the castle be attacked the lions will come to life and attack the besieging army. The lions are magical beings and require magical leadership. Should the lion in the courtyard be destroyed the lions will crumble, unless a mage can take command over the remaining lions.
