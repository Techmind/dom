The demonologist inscribes a pentagram on the floor of his summoning chamber and opens a gate in each point of the star. Fiends from five infernal realms enter this world simultaneously in an attempt to prevent forces from the other gates from emerging. Trapped by the pentagram, all five are bound by the demonologist for a lifetime and a day.
