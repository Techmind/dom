This spell gives the mage limited immortality. When the mage is slain, he will explode in a cloud of fire and reappear somewhere else on the battlefield. The spell lasts for the entire battle, no matter how many times the mage is killed. However, being killed is exhausting and the spell will not work while the mage is unconscious.
