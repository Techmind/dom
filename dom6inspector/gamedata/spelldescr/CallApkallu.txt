The Mashmashu contacts the celestial sphere to call upon an Umu-apkallu. The Umu-apkallu are celestial sages blessed by the Wise Waters. They resemble four-winged enkidus of great beauty. They serve as messengers of the celestial sphere and are powerful mages of the stars, the sky and anything beneath it.
