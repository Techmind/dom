The Simulacrum is an almost perfect copy of the caster and will be in play instead of the caster. If the Simulacrum dies the caster will reappear where the ritual was cast.
There is a 80% chance that the caster reappears a month after the simulacrum's death. Each month thereafter the chance is reduced by half. The soul withers away after one year.
