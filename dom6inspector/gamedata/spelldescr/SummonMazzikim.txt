The caster summons a group of Mazzikim from the wild. Mazzikim are imps of the wild who terrorize unwary travelers. They are mischievous rather than malign, but can cause some havoc in enough numbers. Since they are of this world, they can be summoned without a sacrifice of blood, even if demonic by nature.
