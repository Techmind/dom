By casting this spell, the mage allows his magic powers to be guided by a Sabbath master. The caster opens his mind to allow other mages to guide his magic power. Mages who want to take advantage of the sabbath must cast the spell Sabbath Master (or carry an appropriate magic item). Being a sabbath slave can be dangerous if there are multiple sabbath masters or if the master is more skilled than the slave. The sabbath master can continue to drain energy from the sabbath slaves even if they become unconscious. This can be fatal.
