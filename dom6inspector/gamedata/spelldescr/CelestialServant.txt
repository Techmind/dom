This spell summons a Celestial Servant who is loyal to the Empire. The Celestial Servant is a gardener or servitor of the Celestial Sphere. It has the appearance of an obese pig-man. Celestial Servants are very strong, but not very skilled as warriors. They arm themselves with rakes and do not carry armor. Celestial Servants do not need food of this world to survive, but they do love to eat, and they have huge appetites. One Celestial Servant will eat as much food as seven ordinary men.
