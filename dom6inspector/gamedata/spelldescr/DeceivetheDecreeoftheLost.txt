In Magnificent Ind there was a wasteland inhabited by six-fingered giants with skin as pale as death. In ancient times these giants were immensely large and powerful enough to threaten the gods themselves. They were bound to their land by a divine decree, lest they overtake the world. After the fall of Ind the Sage-Queens of Feminie have found the means to circumvent the ancient decree and unleash the Giants upon the world.
