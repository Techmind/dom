The caster summons an Araburu-kami, a malign and violent god sent to Yomi for its bad manners. Araburu-kami resent their situation and will gladly serve anyone who can summon them to this world. Araburu-kami have demonic shapes, but can take the appearance of a noble warrior of extraordinary presence. However, if wounded they cannot uphold their human appearance and revert to their demonic shape. They are revered and considered sacred by the Oni.
