The caster summons and sends a Bukavac to wreak havoc in a distant sea province. This ritual can be cast on land. The Bukavac is a huge and horrible water being with a frightening call and six tentacle-like legs. It lives in the murky lakes of Rus, but is known to wreak havoc in coastal seas, perhaps guided by malign magic.
