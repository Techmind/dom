This enchantment sets the magical ether ablaze by utilizing a huge amount of magic fire gems. As long as the ether is ablaze it will be difficult to manipulate any kind of magic without also taking fire damage from the heat. It is still possible to perform rituals and forge magic items, but if not properly protected the chance of burning to death is high. Performing simple spells in combat is possible without risk as long as they don't require any magic gems. Blood magic is unaffected by this ritual.
