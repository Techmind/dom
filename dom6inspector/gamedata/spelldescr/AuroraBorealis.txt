The caster drapes the night skies in dancing curtains of otherworldly lights. For the remainder of the battle those weak of mind will occasionally stop in their tracks and stare at the otherworldly splendor, regardless of the battles raging around them. The spell can only be cast under an open sky when the sun doesn't shine.
