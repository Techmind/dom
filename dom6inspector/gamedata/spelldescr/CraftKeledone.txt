The caster crafts a Keledone, a wondrous statue of gold, and gives it the ability to sing heavenly songs. The songs of the Keledones are attuned to the music of the spheres and they are constantly joined in an arcane communion. They have the form of beautiful women cast of pure gold. They are too heavy to be moved and cannot move on their own accord.
