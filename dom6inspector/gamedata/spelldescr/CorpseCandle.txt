Some Corpse Candles are summoned to help their summoner in battle. They appear at the edges of the battlefield. A Corpse Candle is a glowing sphere, appearing like the light from a bright green lantern. In combat, its light intensifies and anyone touched by the light will start to age at increased speed. It is very difficult to hit the Corpse Candle in combat due to its great speed and small size.
