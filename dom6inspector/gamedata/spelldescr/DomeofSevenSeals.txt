A magic dome is created over the entire province. The dome offers perfect protection against hostile magic targeted at the province, while allowing friendly mages to temporarily deactivate the seals and have their spells pass through. All friendly astral mages will know how to get through the seals safely. Each time a spell is stopped by the dome, one of the seven seals will crack. Once all seals are cracked or the caster dies the dome will dissolve.
