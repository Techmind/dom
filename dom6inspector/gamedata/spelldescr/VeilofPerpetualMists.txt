The caster shrouds an entire province in mists alive with whispers, screams and harrowing shapes. Anyone trying to enter the province without the consent of the caster will find themselves led astray and leave the province from whence they came. Troops with strong morale will follow their commander, but if he is weak of mind and succumbs to the enchantment they will follow him when he leaves the province. The more magic gems put into the spell, the longer it will last.
