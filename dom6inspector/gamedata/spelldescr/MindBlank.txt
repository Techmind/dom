The caster of this spell will shroud his mind with arcane energies. The next time he is targeted by a mind affecting spell the Mind Blank will disappear and most likely also negate the mind affecting effect. The Mind Blank can also reduce the harmful effects from being targeted by Magic Duel and then losing the duel, turning certain death into just a mental affliction.
