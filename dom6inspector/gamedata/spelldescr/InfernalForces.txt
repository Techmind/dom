The caster summons and binds several Devils and twenty Imps. Devils are infernal beings of great strength. They are born in the fires of the Inferno and are impervious to heat and flame. Their glowing bodies radiate heat and bat-like wings grow from their shoulders. They are armed with a trident and their barbed tail can sting opponents in close combat.
