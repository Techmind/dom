The caster contacts a Kaijin and convinces it to serve the Lord. Kaijin are kami of the sea. They appear as noblemen in sea-colored silken robes. They wield mighty yaris and enchanted nets that can trap even the strongest opponents. Kaijin are mighty mages of water, but they lose some of their powers when they leave their watery realms. The Kaijin do not serve the dragon kings and have long fought the Ryujin for dominance of the deeps.
