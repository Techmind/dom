Massive amounts of death and disease have always been safely locked away at the bottom of the oceans. Maybe the world once had too much disease and the old pantokrator stashed away most of it there as a gesture of generosity. No one knows for sure, but many wise old people seem to remember tales of a god saving the world from a horrible plague. With this enchantment the lock will be opened, just a little, to let the death and disease out into the oceans. All seas will start to get increased death scales until they reach the maximum, at which point everyone will start to get diseased and population will die completely in just a few years time.
