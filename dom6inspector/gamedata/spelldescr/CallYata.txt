Once the Caelian peoples were under the rule of divine beings known as Yazatas and Daevas. When these lesser divinities threatened the world with their never-ending war, they were banished by the Pantokrator. With their disappearance from the world the Caelians gained independence and formed a kingdom of their own, but the memory of the old gods remained. With the aid of arcane rituals it is possible to circumvent the ban and summon the demonic entities of old. Yatas and Pairikas, the most powerful of these ancient demons, are servants of the Daevic Heptad and the Destructive Spirit.
