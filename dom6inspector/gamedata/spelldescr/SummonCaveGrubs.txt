In the deep caverns of the earth strange worms and crawling beasts can be found. The Cave Grubs are huge larvae with highly corrosive saliva able to dig through the earth and stone of the under-earth. Their tunnels are used by the Pale ones and other cave dwellers. Cave Grubs have weak minds and are easy to control and compel with magic, but they need magical leadership. They are sometimes summoned to be used in sieges.
