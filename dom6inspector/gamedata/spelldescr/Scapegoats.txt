With a sacrifice of blood, the caster prepares two goats and presents them with the sins of the people. One goat is for the Lord and one for Azazel. The scapegoats are then sent into the desert carrying the sins of the people. Soon two Se'irim, goat-demons spawned by Azazel, return from the desert to serve the priest. The Se'irim were sacred to the Hinnomites that influenced the Berytian priests and they call the Se'irim sacred as well. The spell can only be cast in wastelands.
