With the help of glamour a fortification and everything in it is made perfect, at least that is how it seems. The air is cleaner, the food tastes better, the streets are always clean and all the buildings are in better shape than when they were just built. The fortification also looks perfectly fine, no matter how much damage it sustains. This makes it very difficult to figure out how to breach the walls, but when they are finally breached the opening will be seen.
