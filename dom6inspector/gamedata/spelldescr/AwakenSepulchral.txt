A Ktonian Necromancer summons the soul of a dead Seal Guard and makes it repossess its mummified body. Since the Breaking of the Seal the veil between the underworld and the world of the living seems to be shredded and torn, and with their considerable knowledge in necromancy, the Ktonian Necromancers have managed to summon even the most reluctant souls, once sworn to defend the Chamber of the Seal. Sepulchrals are sacred undead and wield magical obsidian glaives.
