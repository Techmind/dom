With a sacrifice of blood, the caster summons five Se'irim from the desert. The Se'irim are goat-demons begotten by Azazel, Bringer and Taker of Civilization. The Se'irim are sacred to Avvim and the Horim have encountered them in the desert and mistakenly worship them as lords of the wild. The spell can only be cast in wastelands.
