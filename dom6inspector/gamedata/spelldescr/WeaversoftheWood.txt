The caster makes spiders large and small weave a giant web covering an entire forest province. Anyone trying to sneak through the forest is highly likely to be detected as the caster monitors the webs. The caster of the ritual will be able to direct both the local patrolling forces and spiders from the woods in order to attack any trespassers. The ritual will break if the caster leaves the province.
