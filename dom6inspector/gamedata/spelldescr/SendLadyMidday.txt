The Lady Midday is a malign spirit of the noon. She appears as a young girl surrounded by whirling dust and armed with a scythe that stinks of disease. Sometimes she will stop people and ask them a question. Failure to answer results in her displeasure and she will use her scythe to disease or chop off the head of the victim. The caster of this ritual will contact the spirit and force it to appear in a suitable province where it will attack and try to slay a commander.
