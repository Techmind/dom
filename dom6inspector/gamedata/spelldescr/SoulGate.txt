It is the Soul Gate that prevents the souls of the dead from being able to enter the world of the living. This ritual opens the gate and spirits will rush forth into the world. The more powerful ghosts require extra summoning paraphernalia and will only appear in Ermorian temples. The spirits are hostile to all living beings and will aid the Lord of the Ashen Empire in his struggle.
