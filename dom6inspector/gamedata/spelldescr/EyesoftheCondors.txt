The Condor is sacred to the people of Nazca. It is considered a messenger of the sun and herald of storms. No other bird can soar at such heights, thus Condor scouts are rarely seen and almost impossible to catch. With this ritual the caster borrows the all perceiving eyes of the Condors and send the sacred birds to a distant province to scry.
