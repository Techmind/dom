This decree forbids anyone but the rightful Pretender God from manipulating the global enchantments. Any hostile mage trying to cast or dispel a global enchantment must first overcome the arcane decree, which will weaken the manipulation attempt even if it should manage to get through. This also applies to any dispel attempt against the arcane decree.
