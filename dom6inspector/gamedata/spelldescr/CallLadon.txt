The caster summons Ladon, the Hesperian Dragon, and ends its eternal vigil. With the golden apples of immortality no longer guarded by the monster, expeditions to the blessed gardens can be undertaken. Ladon is a many-headed serpent of tremendous size spawned by the Mother of Monsters. The Hesperian Dragon can only be summoned once and when it dies it is gone forever.
