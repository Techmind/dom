The caster summons a Fay Prince from the Dreamwild. The fay are beings of the Dreamwild. They mimic the dreams and legends of mankind and form mock courts with queens ruling over vassals, soldiers and servants. Fay Princes are mighty Fay beings serving their queens with their magic and unparalleled battle prowess. In the dreamwild the lands are divided between the summer courts and the winter courts. If cast in a cold province an Unseelie Prince will appear instead of a Fay Prince.
