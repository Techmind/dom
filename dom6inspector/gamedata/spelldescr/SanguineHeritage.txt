During the Malediction, evil was let loose in the kingdom. The Hunger that was aroused resulted in cannibalism and practices even worse. Some of the warring nobles succumbed and became Vampires thirsting for human blood. Most of them have disappeared or fallen into perpetual sleep since then, but if enough blood is sacrificed, they might well awaken and serve the Dark God of Ulm. This ritual uses 44 blood slaves to awaken one of the sleeping nobles.
