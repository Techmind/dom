The Zamzummite holds a banquet for the deified dead. For three days the living and the shades of the dead share tables and meals. At the eastern end of the table is a throne for the living Adon and at the western end is an empty throne. Each night the ghostly shapes in the empty seats and throne become more solid. At the final night the Zamzummite sacrifices himself at the banquet and is devoured by the dead king who can manifest in the land of the living as a reawakened god. The Malik manifests with his host of Ditanim.
