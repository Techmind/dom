The caster covers the body of a small number of troops in a moist magical moss. The moss has a large chance of providing an extra layer of protection against any attack as well as giving a certain protection against fire. If the moss is struck it has a chance of bursting in a cloud of poison and after that the protective effect will be over. The harder the hit the greater the chance of the moss bursting.
