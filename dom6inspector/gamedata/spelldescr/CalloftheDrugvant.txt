The Drugvant are the People of the Lie, those under the influence of evil intentions. With this ritual the caster lets loose the will of the Destructive Spirit upon a remote land. Falsehood, wickedness and violence will spread in the province and in its wake Daevas will come. Unrest is greatly increased and the province is attacked by bandits and a host of Daevas.
