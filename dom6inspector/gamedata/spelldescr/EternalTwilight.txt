The entire world is stuck in between the day and the night, an eternal twilight. Vision is hampered and it is difficult to discern details. That which is small seems large and that which is close seems far away. Appearances are deceiving and it is difficult to separate dreams from reality. The caster's dominion will protect friendly provinces from any adverse effects, but outside people will struggle in their daily labor. Hostile units must be constantly suspicious of what they see, or they will wander off a cliff or maybe into the sea. This enchantment requires the presence of a single sun in order to function properly.
