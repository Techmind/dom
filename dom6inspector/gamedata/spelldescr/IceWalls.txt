The caster strengthens the walls of a castle by covering them in ice, making the walls very difficult to breach. The ice walls get thicker the colder the province is and will disappear if the province should become non-cold. The alteration lasts as long as the caster remains alive, the province is cold and the fort is not conquered. The enchantment will not help an already breached wall.
