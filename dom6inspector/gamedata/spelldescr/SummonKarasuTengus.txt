The Karasu Tengu is a sacred being of the wild and the winds. It has the appearance of a man with the head, wings and feet of a crow. It is a mischievous being and often harasses humans who dare pass beneath its nest. Tengu are masters of swordsmanship and legends tell of heroes who have been trained by Tengu swordmasters. All Tengu have power over the winds and weather and can fly during storms and unleash lightning upon their enemies.
