Sea monsters will help the local militia defend underwater provinces for as long as this spell is in effect. The defending monsters are dependent on the terrain and type of sea. The monsters require some small degree of leadership and guidance, so a small local defence is required for the enchantment to have any effect, but sometimes a group of monsters can emerge and attack enemy provinces under your dominion. The global enchantment will last until it is dispelled or the caster dies.
