First, the major part of the corpse's midsection is removed and a wooden barrel is inserted in its place. The barrel is filled with Cave Fire, a magic substance discovered by the Alchemists, and the corpse is strengthened with iron parts and reanimated. The resulting Flame Corpse uses the magic fire for extra power and is stronger than an ordinary Soulless. If the Flame Corpse is slain, the fire barrel will instantly explode, which is what makes it so feared by its enemies.
