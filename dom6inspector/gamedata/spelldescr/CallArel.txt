The caster calls down a manifestation of heavenly power from the Celestial Sphere. The Arelim appear as beautiful winged beings. They are the most gentle of all beings of the Celestial Sphere. They nurture nature and are protectors of the weak. They weep for the wounded and follow armies in lamentation of the wars brought by the gifts of the Watchers.
