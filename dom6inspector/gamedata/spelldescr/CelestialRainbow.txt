This ritual creates a rainbow large enough to be seen from everywhere in the world. The mage can direct where he wants the rainbow to appear and by doing this huge amounts of gold can easily be collected at the base of the rainbow. While the rainbow is in place luck will increase in all the caster's provinces. Once the luck is positive in a province the luck of the rainbow will protect it from hostile spells. The more luck in a province, the greater chance of hostile spells failing.
