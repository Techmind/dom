The Nushi is a swamp spirit. It has the appearance of a withered old crone, but takes the appearance of a beautiful woman when in the company of men. When it strikes, it reverts to the crone form and claws its enemies. All Nushis can change shape into serpents if threatened. The Nushi is attuned to its swamp and will gradually wither and die if it leaves its home.
