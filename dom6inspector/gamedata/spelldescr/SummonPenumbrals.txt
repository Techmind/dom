An Oracle or a Ktonian Necromancer ventures down to the deeper reaches of Agartha and the Chamber of the Broken Seal to summon and bind a Penumbral. Penumbrals are shadow beings resembling Pale Ones with elongated faces and drooling mouths. They are the tortured souls of those who died in the Breaking of the Seal. Penumbrals are not at all as rare as they were before the Breaking and the rituals needed to bind them are more easily performed.
