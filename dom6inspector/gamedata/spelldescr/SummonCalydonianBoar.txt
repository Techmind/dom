The caster summons a Calydonian Boar and binds it to his service. The Calydonian Boar is a horrible monster boar with burning eyes, spear-like bristles of iron and tusks like that of an elephant. Anyone unfortunate enough to come close to the dreadful beast is set ablaze by the scorching heat of its eyes. The boar breathes flames and its tusks crackles with lightning.
