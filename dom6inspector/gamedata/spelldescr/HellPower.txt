By sacrificing a large number of blood slaves, the caster attracts attention from the Netherworld. Fiends from beyond grant the caster tremendous physical and magical power for one battle. The price for this power is unwanted attention from other Horrors. For every minute the battle lasts, there is a chance that a Horror will materialize in the vicinity of the caster.
