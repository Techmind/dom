The caster's mind is separated from his body and travels the astral planes in search of enemy commanders' minds. His mind and body are connected with a silvery cord, which can be detected by unfriendly Astral mages. Once detected, the cord of the mage can be severed - a traumatic experience indeed. Each casting of this ritual allows the mage to find and attack one enemy commander in a specific province. The attack will be either a Mind Burn or Soul Slay spell, depending on which spell the caster knows. There will be no attack if he doesn't know either of those spells.
