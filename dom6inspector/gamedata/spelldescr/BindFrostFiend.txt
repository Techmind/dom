The caster sacrifices several blood slaves to contact and bind a Frost Fiend. Frost Fiends are devils from Kokytos, the icy realms of the Inferno. In the constant wars of their native plane, the Frost Fiends are feared by all fiery devils. Frost Fiends wear robes of woven ice and are constantly surrounded by an icy wind. They wield ice rods and can unleash blasts of infernal cold upon their enemies.
