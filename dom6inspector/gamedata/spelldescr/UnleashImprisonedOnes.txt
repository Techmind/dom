Since before the founding of Agartha there has been a forbidden chamber under the Roots of the Earth. Agarthan legends tell of three dark gods of an earlier age imprisoned with the help of the first Pale Ones. The Seal was strengthened with the souls of thousands of Pale Ones who gave their lives to protect the world from the Imprisoned Ones. Now the Seal seems to be weakening and there are rumors of a crack in the Seal. Some Oracles of the Dead have heard silent whispers in their dreams. Whispers of promise. A promise to spare the Agarthan people if the Imprisoned Ones are released. The oldest and most influential of the Oracles of the Dead has spoken against it, but desperate times need desperate measures, and the whispered promise has not been forgotten.
