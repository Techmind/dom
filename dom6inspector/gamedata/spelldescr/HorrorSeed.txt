A Horror is sent to possess a far away enemy. The Horror hides its true self and spreads its evil ways, marking and cursing soldiers in the province. The most horrible ability of the possessing Horror is to infect living soldiers with Parasitic Horrors. These Parasitic Horrors sooner or later break the mind and body of their host, transforming them into full fledged Horrors. Should the host of the Master Horror be slain, the true Horror will manifest and attack everything alive.
