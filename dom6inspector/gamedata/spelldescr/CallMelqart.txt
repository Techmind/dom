The Melqart is a Rephaite king of a city. Once the Rephaim all lived in Hinnom, but when the Berytians founded colonies near Ashdod, they were influenced by Rephaites and began to worship the Rephaite kings as gods. Now most Berytian colonies have a great temple to a Melqart god, praying for its eventual arrival. With this ritual the Blood mage will summon a Melqart to help the empire of Berytos.
