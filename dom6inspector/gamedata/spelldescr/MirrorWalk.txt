With the help of two large flawless and perfectly aligned mirrors, the mirror mage can step into one mirror and then exit through the other regardless of the distance between. The mirror mages make sure that all laboratories are setup with this perfect mirror in order to make it possible for the mages to easily travel between the labs. The mirror walk ritual takes some time to perform, but it consumes very few magic resources.
