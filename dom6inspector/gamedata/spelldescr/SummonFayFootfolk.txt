The caster summons a group of soldiers from the Dreamwild. The Fay mimic the dreams and legends of mankind and form mock courts with queens ruling over vassals, soldiers and servants. Fay Footmen are alabaster-skinned warriors wreathed in illusions. They don shimmering armors of crystal and mother of pearl and their swords are made of dreamwrought glass. In the dreamwild the lands are divided between the summer courts and the winter courts. If cast in a cold province Unseelie Soldiers will appear instead of Fay Footmen.
