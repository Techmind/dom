A frost dome is created over the entire province where the spell is cast. Any spells cast into this dome will trigger the deadly trap. A powerful frost blast will find its way to the enemy mage and freeze him to death. Every spell cast into the dome has a 30 percent chance of being destroyed by the frost dome. The more magic gems put into the spell, the longer it will last. If the mage who cast the dome dies, it will dissolve instantly.
