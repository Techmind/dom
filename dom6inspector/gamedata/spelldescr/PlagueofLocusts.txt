After sacrificing eight and eighty slaves a chasm smoking with sulfur opens in a distant land. From the infernal pit demon locusts swarm forth to bring destruction and heresy. Demonic Locusts appear as giant locusts with crowned human heads and scales of brass and iron. Their shrill angelic voices can be heard for miles and their words are those of false prophets and rebellious demagogues. A swarm of Demonic Locusts will quickly decrease dominion in a province unless dealt with.
