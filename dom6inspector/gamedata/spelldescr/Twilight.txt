The caster shrouds the battlefield in twilight. Vision is slightly hampered and it is difficult to discern details. That which is small seems large and that which is close seems far away. Appearances are deceiving and it is difficult to separate dreams from reality. All glamour mages have their glamour skills empowered as long as the twilight remains. The twilight cannot be cast in darkness, and it is dispelled by battlefield lights as well as darkness.
