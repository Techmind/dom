The caster performs a vast sacrifice of blood to release one of the six Grigori from their infernal prison. The Grigori, or Watchers, were angelic beings who taught the forbidden lore of civilization, warcraft and magic to the Avvim at the dawn of time. The Grigori are still worshiped by the Avvim as bringers of civilization and fathers of the Nephilim.
